Orphaned at three, she was raised by her uncle, a\\r\\nteacher and radical advocate for civil rights. She attended the Academy\\r\\nfor Negro Youth and was educated as a teacher. She became a professional\\r\\nlecturer, activist, suffragette, poet, essayist, novelist, and the author\\r\\nof the first published short story written by an African-American. Her\\r\\nwork spanned more than sixty years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMINNIE\\'S SACRIFICE\\r\\n\\r\\nA Rediscovered Novel by\\r\\n\\r\\nFrances E.W. Harper\\r\\n\\r\\nEdited By Frances Smith Foster\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter I\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMiriam sat in her lowly cabin, painfully rocking her body to and fro;\\r\\nfor a great sorrow had fallen upon her life. She had been the mother of\\r\\nthree children, two had died in their infancy, and now her last, her\\r\\nloved and only child was gone, but not like the rest, who had passed\\r\\naway almost as soon as their little feet had touched the threshold of\\r\\nexistence. She had been entangled in the mazes of sin and sorrow; and\\r\\nher sun had gone down in darkness. It was the old story. Agnes, fair,\\r\\nyoung and beautiful, had been a slave, with no power to protect herself\\r\\nfrom the highest insults that brutality could offer to innocence. Bound\\r\\nhand and foot by that system, which has since gone down in wrath, and\\r\\nblood, and tears, she had fallen a victim to the wiles and power of her\\r\\nmaster; and the result was the introduction of a child of shame into a\\r\\nworld of sin and suffering; for herself an early grave; and for her\\r\\nmother a desolate and breaking heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Miriam was sitting down hopelessly beneath the shadow of her\\r\\nmighty grief, gazing ever and anon on the pale dead face, which seemed\\r\\nto bear in its sad but gentle expression, an appeal from earth to\\r\\nheaven, some of the slaves would hurry in, and looking upon the fair\\r\\nyoung face, would drop a word of pity for the weeping mother, and then\\r\\nhurry on to their appointed tasks. All day long Miriam sat alone with\\r\\nher dead, except when these kindly interruptions broke upon the monotony\\r\\nof her sorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon, Camilla, the only daughter of her master, entered her\\r\\ncabin, and throwing her arms around her neck exclaimed, \"Oh! Mammy, I am\\r\\nso sorry I didn\\'t know Agnes was dead. I\\'ve been on a visit to Mr. Le\\r\\nGrange\\'s plantation, and I\\'ve just got back this afternoon, and as soon\\r\\nas I heard that Agnes was dead I hurried to see you. I would not even\\r\\nwait for my dinner. Oh! how sweet she looks,\" said Camilla, bending over\\r\\nthe corpse, \"just as natural as life. When did she die?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This morning, my poor, dear darling!\" And another burst of anguish\\r\\nrelieved the overcharged heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Mammy, don\\'t cry, I am so sorry; but what is this?\" said she, as\\r\\nthe little bundle of flannel began to stir.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is poor Agnes\\' baby.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Agnes\\' baby? Why, I didn\\'t know that Agnes had a baby. Do let me see\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTenderly the grandmother unfolded the wrappings, and presented the\\r\\nlittle stranger. He was a beautiful babe, whose golden hair, bright blue\\r\\neyes and fair complexion showed no trace of the outcast blood in his\\r\\nveins.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, how beautiful!\" said Camilla; \"surely this can\\'t be Agnes\\' baby. He\\r\\nis just as white as I am, and his eyes--what a beautiful blue--and his\\r\\nhair, why it is really lovely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is very pretty, Miss, but after all he is only a slave.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA slave. She had heard that word before; but somehow, when applied to\\r\\nthat fair child, it grated harshly on her ear; and she said, \"Well, I\\r\\nthink it is a shame for him to be a slave, when he is just as white as\\r\\nanybody. Now, Mammy,\" said she, throwing off her hat, and looking\\r\\nsoberly into the fire, \"if I had my way, he should never be a slave.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why can\\'t you have your way? I\\'m sure master humors you in\\r\\neverything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know that; Pa does everything I wish him to do; but I don\\'t know how\\r\\nI could manage about this. If his mother were living, I would beg Pa to\\r\\nset them both free, and send them North; but his mother is gone; and,\\r\\nMammy, we couldn\\'t spare you. And besides, it is so cold in the North,\\r\\nyou would freeze to death, and yet, I can\\'t bear the thought of his\\r\\nbeing a slave. I wonder,\" said she, musing to herself, \"I wonder if I\\r\\ncouldn\\'t save him from being a slave. Now I have it,\" she said, rising\\r\\nhastily, her face aglow with pleasurable excitement. \"I was reading\\r\\nyesterday a beautiful story in the Bible about a wicked king, who wanted\\r\\nto kill all the little boys of a people who were enslaved in his land,\\r\\nand how his mother hid her child by the side of a river, and that the\\r\\nking\\'s daughter found him and saved his life. It was a fine story; and I\\r\\nread it till I cried. Now I mean to do something like that good\\r\\nprincess. I am going to ask Pa, to let me take him to the house, and\\r\\nhave a nurse for him, and bring him up like a white child, and never let\\r\\nhim know that he is colored.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiriam shook her head doubtfully; and Camilla, looking disappointed,\\r\\nsaid, \"Don\\'t you like my plan?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Laws, honey, it would be fustrate, but your Pa wouldn\\'t hear to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, he would, Mammy, because I\\'ll tell him I\\'ve set my heart upon it,\\r\\nand won\\'t be satisfied if he don\\'t consent. I know if I set my heart\\r\\nupon it, he won\\'t refuse me, because he always said he hates to see me\\r\\nfret. Why, Mammy, he bought me two thousand dollars worth of jewelry\\r\\nwhen we were in New York, just because I took a fancy to a diamond set\\r\\nwhich I saw at Tiffany\\'s. Anyhow, I am going to ask him.\" Eager and\\r\\nanxious to carry out her plan, Camilla left the cabin to find her\\r\\nfather. He was seated in his library, reading Homer. He looked up, as\\r\\nher light step fell upon the threshold, and said playfully, \"What is\\r\\nyour wish, my princess? Tell me, if it is the half of my kingdom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEncouraged by his manner, she drew near, perched upon his knee, and\\r\\nsaid; \"Now, you must keep your word, Pa. I have a request to make, but\\r\\nyou must first promise me that you will grant it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I don\\'t know what it is. I can\\'t tell. You might want me to put my\\r\\nhead in the fire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh no, Pa, you know I don\\'t!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you might wish me to run for Congress.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh no, Pa, I know that you hate politics.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, darling, what is your request?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; tell me first that you will grant it. Now, don\\'t tease me, Pa; say\\r\\nyes, and I will tell you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, yes; if it is anything in reason.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it is in reason, let me tell you, Pa. To-day, after I came home,\\r\\nI asked Annette where was Agnes, and she told me she was dead. Oh I was\\r\\nso sorry; and so before I got my dinner I hastened to Mammy\\'s cabin, and\\r\\nfound poor Mammy almost heart-broken, and Agnes lying dead, but looking\\r\\njust as natural as life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She was dead, but had left one of the dearest little babies I ever saw.\\r\\nWhy, Pa, he is just as white as we are; and I told Mammy so, but she\\r\\nsaid it didn\\'t matter; \\'he is a poor slave, just like the rest of us.\\'\\r\\nNow, Pa, I don\\'t want Agnes\\' baby to be a slave. Can\\'t you keep him from\\r\\ngrowing up a slave?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How am I to do that, my little Abolitionist?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Pa, I am not an Abolitionist. I heard some of them talk when I was\\r\\nin New York, and I think they are horrid creatures; but, Pa, this child\\r\\nis so white, nobody would ever know that he had one drop of Negro blood\\r\\nin his veins. Couldn\\'t we take him out of that cabin, and make all the\\r\\nservants promise that they would never breathe a word about his being\\r\\ncolored, and let me bring him up as a white child?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Le Croix, bursting into a hearty laugh, \"that is a\\r\\ncapital joke; my little dewdrop talk of bringing up a child! Why,\\r\\ndarling, you would tire of him in a week.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh no, Pa, I wouldn\\'t! Just try me; if it is only for a week.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, Sunbeam, it is impossible. Who ever heard of such a thing as a\\r\\nNegro being palmed upon society as a white person?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Negro! Pa, he is just as white as you are, and his eyes are as blue as\\r\\nmine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Still he belongs to the Negro race; and one drop of that blood in his\\r\\nveins curses all the rest. I would grant you anything in reason, but\\r\\nthis is not to be thought of. Were I to do so I would immediately lose\\r\\ncaste among all the planters in the neighborhood; I would be set down as\\r\\nan Abolitionist, and singled out for insult and injury. Ask me anything,\\r\\nCamilla, but that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Pa, what do you care about social position? You never hunt, nor\\r\\nentertain company, nor take any part in politics. You shut yourself up\\r\\nin your library, year after year, and pore over your musty books, and\\r\\nhardly any one knows whether you are dead or alive. And I am sure that\\r\\nwe could hide the secret of his birth, and pass him off as the orphan\\r\\nchild of one of our friends, and that will be the truth; for Agnes was\\r\\nour friend; at least I know she was mine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'ll see about it; now, get down, and let me finish reading this\\r\\nchapter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day Camilla went again to the cabin of Miriam; but the overseer\\r\\nhad set her to a task in the field, and Agnes\\' baby w'"

There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann's becomes too thick and gluey.\",\n",

What I personally like about McCann's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.<br />  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you'll end up with six ten-count boxes.

You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I\\'d found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.

Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I\\'d eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration.

I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured \"food\" items.  I really don\\'t think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it\\'s own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don\\'t use any low-fat milk. Or don\\'t add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.',\n",

What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties.  I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it.  Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not.  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...<br /><br />Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.

I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.

       " 'This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something \"strawberry\" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively \"healthy\" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I\\'ve also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it\\'s still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You\\'ll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.',\n",

       " \"we have fed our cats a lot of stuff. These 2 boy cats are not picky eaters. They loved the Purina. They loved the Nutro. They loved the Iams. They love whatever we feed them.<br /><br />This review is based on what we, their affectionate owners love. After a certain age, we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods- and lower carb foods, because the catties were fatties. We tried a few types of food. Some evinced no change. Some made the litter super-stink.  Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didn't have to chew it to swallow it...<br /><br />This Felidae has done the trick. No problems to speak of. It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose. The cats love it. The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing. And here's the kicker:<br />After feeding the cats Felidae, their demeanor improved. Their coats are super soft and lush- both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food. We're now loyal Felidae consumers.<br /><br />Additionally, the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with cat-allergies.\",\n",
       " \"I started my cat on Felidae Platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it. She's an older cat, somewhat overweight, and had a grouchy temperament. I first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which -- she ate the Felidae and left the old food! She's now been on just the Felidae for about ten days now, off the old food entirely, and she is a much sweeter, happier cat. I think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested, or something. In any case, I am a happy purchaser of Felidae. I don't agree with the previous reviewer that cats don't like it. Clearly, mine does.\",\n",

The other two are arthritic and skinny.<br /><br />Since we had such success with Canidae Platinum for senior dogs, I figured that we\\'d give it a try for our cats.  I\\'d had them on low ash Purina One Urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no UT problems.<br /><br />Buster, the youngest, is still a blob after six months plus on Felidae for Senior and Overweight cats.  However, the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really \"feeling better\" since we changed their food to Felidae.  Even Prissy, the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her, where before when she was on Purina One, all she wanted to do was to sleep.<br /><br />I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems, it\\'ll be more effective.<br /><br />However, the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life.',\n",

       " 'As with canidae, Felidae has also changed their formula.  Cats do not like change when it comes to their food.  And they just had to change it without putting it on their label.  We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell.  (As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae, and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues.)<br /><br />Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home.  If cats get \"upset\" because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating.  It depends on the cat.  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight.  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal.  It has been a year since then and they are better.  Then the formula for this food changed.<br /><br />We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us.  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food.  It wasn\\'t until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick.  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven\\'t suffered one bit like our dogs have.<br /><br />Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating.  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it!  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats, none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula.<br /><br />I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal.  As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals, and tell me not to buy it.  This is just horrible!',\n",

I've also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasn't as spicy as this mix is.<br /><br />If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind. To me it was more than medium hot but not by too much.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and it's versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it. You take a plastic bag, a couple of tbs of vegetable oil, 1/4 cup water and mix the seasoning, water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes. In the meantime, it says to stir fry your veggies (peppers and onion) but I found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and I don't think it affected quality or taste.

Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when they're sitting on our laps but, you know. They're dogs.<br /><br />When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon. It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco. But, they continued to have gas. I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony.<br /><br />Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long. Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow. Much better. Granted, they don't like it as much, but we humans like it a whole lot better.\",\n",

If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.<br /><br />Now you're NOT sensitive to caffeine, then it's a great buy. It's not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It's not loaded w/ a bunch of chemicals like 5-Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours.

I'd estimate about 25% of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces, most likely due to the shaking about in transit. Not a problem since I sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes. There was a small amount (perhaps an ounce or so) of very small/minced-size/dust-like pieces. Still useful to add into gravies and the like. Nothing gets wasted!<br /><br />The label says it is a product of China and Italy. Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country.<br /><br />I'm quite fond of dried mushrooms. While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones, the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus. Additionally, I find the broth used to re-hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews. To save time and add flavor, I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re-hydrating them. Really helps meld all the flavors together. I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta. The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroom-infused water.<br /><br />This was the first time I used the Roland brand (got it on a price dip from the Amazon Warehouse), and would certainly buy them again.

You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.

On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.

I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven\\'t eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag.',\n",

Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.

The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them.

I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn\\'t beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn\\'t that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I\\'m getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they\\'re hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they\\'re also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.

       " 'I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  \"What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes \"cheaper\". I don\\'t know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.\"  I did receive a reply: \"Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the \"best before\" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.\"  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the \"bad\" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same...',\n",

The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a \"Potato Chip Diet\".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I\\'d like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I\\'ve taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn\\'t like to eat.

I guess without advertising, it just never found a home.<br /><br />I prefer the plastic bottles, but the ideal size is the 16.9 oz (500 ml) or the one liter.  The problem with the two liter size is that it takes one person (me) too long to drink it, letting it go flat.<br /><br />In any case, Vernor's is unique in that it is aged in oak for three years, I think.  That imparts a great, unique flavor.<br /><br />I wish it would catch on again, and become available more widely.<br /><br />(Recently I did see it on sale in Redwood City in California's Bay Area, south of San Francisco.  The next day, it was gone!\",\n",
       " 'I like \"Vernor\\'s\", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor\\'s is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor\\'s is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can\\'t find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment.

However, when it was in stock, it was priced well for the 2-pack.<br /><br />Other than baking, I've used it to top waffles, pancakes, and in small doses (1/2 teaspoon) added it to oatmeal. A little goes a long way.<br /><br />Using agave nectar: Use 1/3 to 1/2 less agave nectar than you would another sweetener (depending on your taste and the recipe. Recipes with dried fruit need much less), cut the heat in the oven by 25 degrees F; if there is oil in the recipe, cut it by 1/3 (alternately, use a tablespoon or two of sifted coconut flour to absorb more of the liquid -- just don't use too much or your recipe will be dry). Additionally, when baking, make sure to mix it with the wet ingredients prior to adding it to the dry. Most bakers might already know this, but remember to read recipes first because sugar is typically added with dry ingredients (unless beaten with butter first).<br /><br />Agave nectar does not crystalize like other sugars do, so you won't be able to substitute it for corn syrup in making hard candy.

The taste is mellow,and the sweetening power is higher than sugar [so you use less], but without the \"twang\" of honey. the one thing I have not tried it on (still using sugar) is making kombucha - I still use sugar, as I\\'m not sure it would be a good idea to introduce a raw element into kombucha. But actually, that may just be my own over-caution and nothing related to actual chemistry or circumstance.<br /><br />Our primary uses are sweetening yogurt, using it in the little baking I do, and use in salad dressings, fruit desserts, etc. Because we are limiting our sweets consumption,we don\\'t use a lot of this, but it\\'s nice to have when we need it. I plan to try using it in some homemade jams later this season. I buy it on subscription, and the cost is about 33% less than the local WalMart and more than 50% less than the health food store on this same brand. \"Best by\" date on the bottles I received in May is 2015.',\n",

Learning how to use it what the first thing I had to learn, once I learned how to use it, I became hooked. I would not even look at sugar any more. I highly reccomend if you want a clean fresh taste and feel to your foods.If you do purchase this sweetner, take advantage of ship and save, it will save you lots of money in the long run.',\n",

I've tried supermarkets, health food stores and wholesale clubs. The prices are usually around $13 for a 32oz bottle and this is $19ish for 2x46oz. It's used like honey - substitute 2/3c for every 1c sugar and reduce liquids by 1/4th.<br /><br />I also use it in a carrot cake recipe (equal substitution) instead of sugar where I substitute whole wheat flour instead of white flour and I don't decrease the other liquids.

Horrible experience, bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever.

My personal use is to add this to kombucha, maximizing it's longevity that way, I've tried many but this one is the best for kombucha.

It's quite tasty in that it's not too sweet, very thick textured even with the tiny bits of seed in it reminiscent of a banana smoothie. The ingredient list is somewhat confusing but note that only the Acerola Cherry is from concentrate, everything else is fresh pressed. Acai is very high on the ORAC scale of anti-oxidants, Rose Hips are also very high, everything else is in the mid to high range of fruit. Pomegranate has many beneficial properties beyond just anti-oxidants as well, it's a noteworthy fighter of heart disease and Alzheimer's type dementia.

The main value is as a unique gift.<br />  In the Japanese soy sauce world, there are 4 types: regular, mild (usukuchi), for raw fish (sashimi) and light colored.  Bluegrass soy sauce is regular style.  Compared to Kikoman (a good commercial brand that is widely available) Bluegrass starts saltier, is flat in the middle, then ends with a complex & interesting flavor.  Kikoman is less salty initially and has a round, full flavor in the middle.  Doesn't have the complex ending flavors.  For me, the initial saltiness of Bluegrass is a minus and Kikoman's full middle flavor is a plus.  I prefere Kikoman, especially for dipping sushi where the flavor is more direct.  But I lived in Japan for many years and am used to the standard Japanese flavor.  I haven't tried Bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor, which is how soy sauce is usually used.<br />  Bluegrass is a perfectly good soy sauce.  Each brand has a different flavor and everyone has their favorite.

The packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love Japanese product design!  :)  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top.<br /><br />Each of the packets has 210 calories (90 from fat), and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.

       " 'I bought these back in January and never got around to reviewing them. I had heard many people rave about a Japanese snack called Pocky so I figured I would try it out. Just like the description states, its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate. I wouldn\\'t say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess, well, as long as the chocolate doesn\\'t melt. Anyways, in case anyone is wondering, I ordered from a seller named Very asia (amazon.com/gp/help/seller/at-a-glance.html?ie=UTF8&isAmazonFulfilled=0&orderID=103-7071944-5595443&marketplaceSeller=1&seller=A3JW437I54SEI1). I believe it took around a 3 weeks to actually get to me (maybe it had to be imported) but when it did, it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever. I\\'m definitely considering re-stocking on this in the future if I can\\'t find a local store<br /><br />EDIT: Oct 11, 2012<br /><br />*****Inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchase*****<br /><br />So I decided to restock after I couldn\\'t fight the craving anymore. Unfortunately the batch this time was not so good (ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through Amazon Prime). What I received was not the picture shown on the front page (2 per pack japanese pocky), it was a 1 per pack pocky~ish thing from Thailand. In my opinion, the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back. Packaging was fine and I ordered in October when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door. The sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste, more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate. The original Japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth, this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouth.<br /><br />Personally I like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor. I also have terrible self control so I buy things that come in small portions in order to a) not eat everything at once and b) avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items. I can honestly say that I won\\'t be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because I and my stomach dislike it so much. I won\\'t change my original rating because that still holds true for the Japanese pocky but if I were to rate only the Thailand pocky it would be a 3. The taste isn\\'t \"terrible\" but its definitely not to my liking. If possible I will be uploading some pictures of what I received.',\n",

       " 'Pocky is just plain fun to eat. I discovered these snacks at an anime convention (though I\\'d heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them). They are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff (the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels) that have a charming tiny popping crispness. The chocolate flavor, a nice non-bitter, non-dark, generically pleasing choco-taste, seems to be the most popular (given how fast they sell out at cons), but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream. Very nice.<br /><br />This is by no means a health food (it\\'s in the same category as a cookie, it\\'s got fat and sugar and non-healthful ingredients). But hey, it\\'s junk food. We all know it\\'s supposed to be OCCASIONAL and not habitual in the diet. Unless you\\'re really prone to binge-eating or can\\'t stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number. 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat, 3 of them saturated. I wouldn\\'t recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes. In fact, just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effect.<br /><br />If you love the flavor of coconut-chocolate together (like Almond Joy) try the coconut chocolate ones. They\\'re really so good, oh man. Hubby says the taste reminds him of the Girl Scout \\'caramel delights\" cookies which are, in turn, similar to the old Yes Yes cookies (from the seventies or so).<br /><br />Anyway, if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick-looking treats, or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats, this is what they were eating. :) Fun treats.<br /><br />However, with this crazy hot summer, I\\'d recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until fall\\'s cooler weather. You might get a sticky, clumped mess of Pocky sticks in this deep summer weather.

If they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25% of the space inside the box.<br /><br />As far as taste goes they are so-so. On the dry side with a hint of berry flavor. Celiacs, who are used to inferior products, won\\'t be disappointed in the taste of this one.<br /><br />I\\'ve also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging.

They are very dense and filling-not a 'soft bar' and we always eat them while having some liquid to drink at the same time.\",\n",

My 6mo son was diagnosed with some severe FA and since he's still breastfed, I had to drastically alter my diet.<br /><br />Before learning about this brand, I was stuck eating chicken breasts with potatoes for every meal.  So when I stumbled upon this at my local Whole Foods, I was very excited to try it.<br /><br />Overall, I really like them.  It's got pretty good texture, taste and heft.  It's not so dense that you want to gag after two bites but also not so light that you can eat the whole box (which really isn't that big).<br /><br />I know alot of people complain about the size/packaging and I agree somewhat.  But each bar is an ounce and 120 calories... on par with many other breakfast bars.  I like the Berry flavor the best, it's the closest to real, non FA specialty flavor. Overally, I'm grateful for these bars because now I can tote several in my diaper bag and car and know that when I really need a quick snack, I won't be left stranded.\",\n",

       " \"For those looking for a more exotic tea drinking experience and who like white Jasmine tea, Numi's Flower Jewel is worth a look. About the size of a gum-ball, these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower. They are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this tea.<br /><br />Decorative does not mean tasteless. As a white tea, the flavor is mild, but rich and soothing. The jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea. I have had stronger jasmine teas, but this one is quite balanced and tasty. I used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than 7 yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade. The white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and don't get bitter if seeped for long periods.<br /><br />I must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels. Pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart, though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact. Some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf. Better packaging might solve this.<br /><br />If you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells, or are entertaining and want a conversation piece, then Numi Tea Flower Jewel should be on your short list.\",\n",

She had problems with constipation for about 2.5 months, sometimes going up to 10 days before we had to give her a suppository, and then I discovered that this food makes her poop every time (I also started giving her a sippy cup of water with meals and during the day to help with the fiber).

The truth is, is that yes, it has a bit of fruit in it, but its not sweet at all. The fruit merely brings out the flavors naturally so that you don't have to add anything else.

My nephews and my niece also liked this flavor, so it's a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you don't know a particular baby's preferences.<br />Something I wish I had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other Stage 2 Earth's Best, especially for having chicken.

As I was ordering it I also saw the Sassafras Teabags.  I thought I'd order a box to try.  I was very dissapointed.  It didn't taste like the flat rootbeer I was expecting.  It was more like black licorice, which I hate, with a very mild rootbeer undertone.  It also didn't have the distinctive red color that you get by steeping the sassafras root.<br /><br />I've never had real Sassafras tea made with the root so I don't know if the teabags are more like the real thing or not.

I really enjoy the Starbucks VIA instant coffee - but I drink so much, it is rather expensive so I thought I would give this a try.  Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with the taste.  I don't think it equals fresh brewed but it is very acceptable.  I bought my first 38 pack at my local grocery store for about $7.  That seemed a little high but I figured I would check online to find the best price.  As I started calculating all of the online prices, they are charging about $7 bucks for the 19 count.  I would suggest that you check your local grocery stores as you might be able to find it cheaper.  So you don't have to do the math...$7 / 38 = .184 per single.  Online price $27 / 114 = .236 (shipping not calculated in).  Looking at a supposed discount coffee supplier, you can get a case of 12 boxes for $69, no sales tax and free shipping...sounds like a great deal??  12 x 19 = 228 singles so $69 / 228 = .302 per single - the most expensive at all.\",\n",

We do this because often we care more about the core content of the word (i.e. that it has something to do with growth or running, rather than the fact that it's a third person present tense verb, or progressive participle).\n",

Again, there are many different [alternatives](https://github.com/nltk/nltk/tree/develop/nltk/tag), but NLTK keeps its recommended POS tagger available through the function `pos_tag`. The tagger expects a list of tokens as input.When doing POS tagging, it is advisable **not** to remove stop words beforehand (although you are free to do it afterwards)."

       "'I hear that John Andrews has given up his saloon; and a foolish thing\\nit was. He was doing a splendid business. What could have induced him?\"\\n\\n\"They say that his wife was bitterly opposed to the business. I don\\'t\\nknow, but I think it quite likely. She has never seemed happy since John\\nhas kept saloon.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I would never let any woman lead me by the nose. I would let her\\nknow that as the living comes by me, the way of getting it is my affair,\\nnot hers, as long as she is well provided for.\"\\n\\n\"All men are not alike, and I confess that I value the peace and\\nhappiness of my home more than anything else; and I would not like to\\nengage in any business which I knew was a source of constant pain to my\\nwife.\"\\n\\n\"But, what right has a woman to complain, if she has every thing she\\nwants. I would let her know pretty soon who holds the reins, if I had\\nsuch an unreasonable creature to deal with. I think as much of my wife\\nas any man, but I want her to know her place, and I know mine.\"\\n\\n\"What do you call her place?\"\\n\\n\"I call her place staying at home and attending to her own affairs. Were\\nI a laboring man I would never want my wife to take in work. When a\\nwoman has too much on hand, something has to be neglected. Now I always\\nfurnish my wife with sufficient help and supply every want but how I get\\nthe living, and where I go, and what company I keep, is my own business,\\nand I would not allow the best woman in the world to interfere. I have\\noften heard women say that they did not care what their husbands did, so\\nthat they provided for them; and I think such conclusions are very\\nsensible.\"\\n\\n\"Well, John, I do not think so. I think a woman must be very selfish, if\\nall she cares for her husband is, to have a good provider. I think her\\nhusband\\'s honor and welfare should be as dear to her as her own; and no\\ntrue woman and wife can be indifferent to the moral welfare of her\\nhusband. Neither man nor woman can live by bread alone in the highest\\nand best sense of the term.\"\\n\\n\"Now Paul, don\\'t go to preaching. You have always got some moon struck\\ntheories, some wild, visionary and impracticable ideas, which would work\\nfirst rate, if men were angels and earth a paradise. Now don\\'t be so\\nserious, old fellow; but you know on this religion business, you and I\\nalways part company. You are always up in the clouds, while I am trying\\nto invest in a few acres, or town lots of solid _terra firma_.\"\\n\\n\"And would your hold on earthly possessions, be less firm because you\\nlooked beyond the seen to the unseen?\"\\n\\n\"I think it would, if I let conscience interfere constantly, with every\\nbusiness transaction I undertook. Now last week you lost $500 fair and\\nsquare, because you would not foreclose that mortgage on Smith\\'s\\nproperty. I told you that \\'business is business,\\' and that while I\\npitied the poor man, I would not have risked my money that way, but you\\nsaid that conscience would not let you; that while other creditors were\\ngathering like hungry vultures around the poor man, you would not join\\nwith them, and that you did not believe in striking a man when he is\\ndown. Now Paul, as a business man, if you want to succeed, you have got\\nto look at business in a practical, common sense way. Smith is dead, and\\nwhere is your money now?\"\\n\\n\"Apparently lost; but the time may come when I shall feel that it was\\none of the best investments I ever made. Stranger things than that have\\nhappened. I confess that I felt the loss and it has somewhat cramped my\\nbusiness. Yet if it was to do over again, I don\\'t think that I would act\\ndifferently, and when I believe that Smith\\'s death was hurried on by\\nanxiety and business troubles, while I regret the loss of my money, I am\\nthankful that I did not press my claim.\"\\n\\n\"Sour grapes, but you are right to put the best face on matters.\"\\n\\n\"No, if it were to do over again, I never would push a struggling man to\\nthe wall when he was making a desperate fight for his wife and little\\nones.\"\\n\\n\"Well! Paul, we are both young men just commencing life, and my motto is\\nto look out for Number 1, and you--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! I believe in lending a helping hand.\"\\n\\n\"So do I, when I can make every corner out to my advantage. I believe in\\nevery man looking out for himself.\"\\n\\nYou will see by the dialogue, that the characters I here introduce are\\nthe antipodes of each other. They had both been pupils in the same\\nschool, and in after life, being engaged as grocers, they frequently met\\nand renewed their acquaintance. They were both established in business,\\nhaving passed the threshold of that important event, \"Setting out in\\nlife.\" As far as their outward life was concerned, they were\\nacquaintances; but to each other\\'s inner life they were strangers. John\\nAnderson has a fine robust constitution, good intellectual abilities,\\nand superior business faculties. He is eager, keen and alert, and if\\nthere is one article of faith that moulds and colors all his life more\\nthan anything else, it is a firm and unfaltering belief in the \"main\\nchance.\" He has made up his mind to be rich, and his highest ideal of\\nexistence may be expressed in four words--_getting on in life_. To this\\nobject, he is ready to sacrifice time, talent, energy and every faculty,\\nwhich he possesses. Nay, he will go farther; he will spend honor,\\nconscience and manhood, in an eager search for gold. He will change his\\nheart into a ledger on which he will write _tare_ and _tret_, loss and\\ngain, exchange and barter, and he will succeed, as worldly men count\\nsuccess. He will add house to house; he will encompass the means of\\nluxury; his purse will be plethoric but, oh, how poverty stricken his\\nsoul will be. Costly viands will please his taste, but unappeased hunger\\nwill gnaw at his soul. Amid the blasts of winter he will have the warmth\\nof Calcutta in his home; and the health of the ocean and the breezes of\\nthe mountains shall fan his brow, amid the heats of summer, but there\\nwill be a coolness in his soul that no breath of summer can ever dispel;\\na fever in his spirit that no frozen confection can ever allay; he shall\\nbe rich in lands and houses, but fear of loss and a sense of poverty\\nwill poison the fountains of his life; and unless he repent, he shall go\\nout into the eternities a pauper and a bankrupt.\\n\\nPaul Clifford, whom we have also introduced to you, was the only son of\\na widow, whose young life had been overshadowed by the curse of\\nintemperance. Her husband, a man of splendid abilities and magnificent\\nculture, had fallen a victim to the wine cup. With true womanly devotion\\nshe had clung to him in the darkest hours, until death had broken his\\nhold in life, and he was laid away the wreck of his former self in a\\ndrunkard\\'s grave. Gathering up the remains of what had been an ample\\nfortune, she installed herself in an humble and unpretending home in the\\nsuburbs of the city of B., and there with loving solicitude she had\\nwatched over and superintended the education of her only son. He was a\\npromising boy, full [of?] life and vivacity, having inherited much of\\nthe careless joyousness of his father\\'s temperament; and although he\\nwas the light and joy of his home, yet his mother sometimes felt as if\\nher heart was contracting with a spasm of agony, when she remembered\\nthat it was through that same geniality of disposition and wonderful\\nfascination of manner, the tempter had woven his meshes for her husband,\\nand that the qualities that made him so desirable at home, made him\\nequally so to his jovial, careless, inexperienced companions. Fearful\\nthat the appetite for strong drink might have been transmitted to her\\nchild as a fatal legacy of sin, she sedulously endeavored to develop\\nwithin him self control, feeling that the lack of it is a prolific cause\\nof misery and crime, and she spared no pains to create within his mind a\\nhorror of intemperance, and when he was old enough to understand the\\nnature of a vow, she knelt with him in earnest prayer, and pledging him\\nto eternal enmity against everything that would intoxicate, whether\\nfermented or distilled. In the morning she sowed the seed which she\\nhoped would blossom in time, and bear fruit throughout eternity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter II\\n\\n\\nThe Decision[1]\\n\\n\"I hear Belle,\" said Jeanette Roland[2] addressing her cousin Belle\\nGordon, \"that you have refused an excellent offer of marriage.\"\\n\\n\"Who said so?\"\\n\\n\"Aunt Emma.\"\\n\\n\"I am very sorry that Ma told you, I think such things should be kept\\nsacred from comment, and I think the woman is wanting in refinement and\\ndelicacy of feeling who makes the rejection of a lover a theme for\\nconversation.\"\\n\\n\"Now you dear little prude I had no idea that you would take it so\\nseriously but Aunt Emma was so disappointed and spoke of the rejected\\nsuitor in such glowing terms, and said that you had sacrificed a\\nsplendid opportunity because of some squeamish notions on the subject of\\ntemperance, and so of course, my dear cousin, it was just like me to let\\nmy curiosity overstep the bounds of prudence, and inquire why you\\nrejected Mr. Romaine.\"[3]\\n\\n\"Because I could not trust him.\"\\n\\n\"Couldn\\'t trust him? Why Belle you are a greater enigma than ever. Why\\nnot?\"\\n\\n\"Because I feel that the hands of a moderate drinker are not steady\\nenough to hold my future happiness.\"\\n\\n\"Was that all? Why I breathe again, we girls would have to refuse almost\\nevery young man in our set, were we to take that stand.\"\\n\\n\"And suppose you were, would that be any greater misfortune than to be\\nthe wives of drunkards.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see the least danger. Ma has wine at her entertainments, and I\\nhave often handed it to young gentlemen, and I don\\'t see the least harm\\nin it. On last New Year\\'s day we had more than fifty callers. Ma and I\\nhanded wine, to every one of them.\" \"Oh I do wish people would abandon\\nthat pernicious custom of handing around wine on New Year\\'s day. I do\\nthink it is a dangerous and reprehensible thing.\"\\n\\n\"Wherein lies the danger? Of course I do not approve of young men\\ndrinking in bar rooms and saloons, but I cannot see any harm in handing\\nround wine at social gatherings. Not to do so would seem so odd.\"\\n\\n\"It is said Jeanette[,?] \\'He is a slave who does not be, in the right\\nwith two or three.\\' It is better, wiser far to stand alone in our\\nintegrity than to join with the multitude in doing wrong. You say while\\nyou do not approve of young men drinking in bar rooms and saloons, that\\nyou have no objection to their drinking beneath the shadow of their\\nhomes, why do you object to their drinking in saloons, and bar rooms?\"\\n\\n\"Because it is vulgar. Oh! I think these bar rooms are horrid places. I\\nwould walk squares out of my way to keep from passing them.\" \"And I\\nobject to intemperance not simply because I think it is vulgar but\\nbecause I know it is wicked; and Jeanette I have a young brother for\\nwhose welfare I am constantly trembling; but I am not afraid that he\\nwill take his first glass of wine in a fashionable saloon, or flashy gin\\npalace, but I do dread his entrance into what you call \\'our set.\\' I fear\\nthat my brother has received as an inheritance a temperament which will\\nbe easily excited by stimulants, that an appetite for liquor once a\\nawakened will be hard to subdue, and I am so fearful, that at some\\nsocial gathering, a thoughtless girl will hand him a glass of wine, and\\nthat the first glass will be like adding fuel to a smouldering fire.\"\\n\\n\"Oh Belle do stop, what a train of horrors you can conjure out of an\\ninnocent glass of wine.\"\\n\\n\"Anything can be innocent that sparkles to betray, that charms at first,\\nbut later will bite like an adder and sting like a serpent.\"\\n\\n\"Really! Belle, if you keep on at this rate you will be a monomaniac on\\nthe temperance question. However I do not think Mr. Romaine will feel\\nhighly complimented to know that you refused him because you dreaded he\\nmight become a drunkard. You surely did not tell him so.\"\\n\\n\"Yes I did, and I do not think that I would have been a true friend to\\nhim, had I not done so.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Belle, I never could have had the courage to have told him so.\"\\n\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\\n\"I would have dreaded hurting his feelings. Were you not afraid of\\noffending him?\"\\n\\n\"I certainly shrank from the pain which I knew I must inflict, but\\nbecause I valued his welfare more than my own feelings, I was\\nconstrained to be faithful to him. I told him that he was drifting where\\nhe ought steer, that instead of holding the helm and rudder of his\\nyoung life, he was floating down the stream, and unless he stood firmly\\non the side of temperance, that I never would clasp hands will him for\\nlife.\"\\n\\n\"But Belle, perhaps you have done him more harm than good; may be you\\ncould have effected his reformation by consenting to marrying him.\"\\n\\n\"Jeanette, were I the wife of a drunken man I do not think there is any\\ndepth of degradation that I would not fathom with my love and pity in\\ntrying to save him. I believe I would cling to him, if even his own\\nmother shrank from him. But I never would consent to [marry any man?],\\nwhom I knew to be un[?]steady in his principles and a moderate drinker.\\nIf his love for me and respect for himself were not strong enough to\\nreform him before marriage, I should despair of effecting it afterwards,\\nand with me in such a case discretion would be the better part of\\nvalor.\"\\n\\n\"And so you have given Mr. Romaine a release?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, he is free.\"\\n\\n\"And I think you have thrown away a splendid opportunity.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think so, the risk was too perilous. Oh Jeanette, I know by\\nmournful and bitter experience what it means to dwell beneath the shadow\\nof a home cursed by intemperance. I know what it is to see that shadow\\ndeepen into the darkness of a drunkard\\'s grave, and I dare not run the\\nfearful risk.\"\\n\\n\"And yet Belle this has cost you a great deal, I can see it in the\\nwanness of your face, in your eyes which in spite of yourself, are\\nfilled with sudden tears, I know from the intonations of your voice that\\nyou are suffering intensely.\"\\n\\n\"Yes Jeanette, I confess, it was like tearing up the roots of my life to\\nlook at this question fairly and squarely in the face, and to say, no;\\nbut I must learn to suffer and be strong, I am deeply pained, it is\\ntrue, but I do not regret the steps I have taken. The man who claims my\\nlove and allegiance, must be a victor and not a slave. The reeling\\nbrain of a drunkard is not a safe foundation on which to build up a new\\nhome.\"\\n\\n\"Well Belle, you may be right, but I think I would have risked it. I\\ndon\\'t think because Mr. Romaine drinks occasionally that I would have\\ngiven him up. Oh young men will sow their wild oats.\"\\n\\n\"And as we sow, so must we reap, and as to saying about young men sowing\\ntheir wild oats, I think it is full of pernicious license. A young man\\nhas no more right to sow his wild oats than a young woman. God never\\nmade one code of ethics for a man and another for a woman. And it is the\\nduty of all true women to demand of men the same standard of morality\\nthat they do of woman.\"\\n\\n\"Ah Belle that is very fine in theory, but you would find it rather\\ndifficult, if you tried to reduce your theory to practice.\"\\n\\n\"All that may be true, but the difficulty of a duty is not a valid\\nexcuse for its non performance.\"\\n\\n\"My dear cousin it is not my role to be a reformer. I take things as I\\nfind them and drift along the tide of circumstances.\"\\n\\n\"And is that your highest ideal of life? Why Jeanette such a life is not\\nworth living.\"\\n\\n\"Whether it is or not, I am living it and I rather enjoy it. Your vexing\\nproblems of life never disturb me. I do not think I am called to turn\\nthis great world \\'right side up with care,\\' and so I float along singing\\nas I go,\\n\\n  \"I\\'d be a butterfly born in a bower\\n  Kissing every rose that is pleasant and sweet,\\n  I\\'d never languish for wealth or for power\\n  I\\'d never sigh to have slaves at my feet.\"\\n\\n\"Such a life would never suit me, life must mean to me more than ease,\\nluxury and indulgence, it must mean aspiration and consecration,\\nendeavor and achievement.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Belle, should we live twenty years longer, I would like to meet\\nyou and see by comparing notes which of us shall have gathered the most\\nsunshine or shadow from life.\"\\n\\n\"Yes Jeanette we will meet in less than twenty years, but before then\\nyour glad light eyes will be dim with tears, and the easy path you have\\nstriven to walk will be thickly strewn with thorn; and whether you\\ndeserve it or not, life will have for you a mournful earnestness, but\\nnotwithstanding all your frivolity and flippancy there is fine gold in\\nyour character, which the fire of affliction only will reveal.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter III\\n\\n\\n[Text missing.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter IV\\n\\n\\n\"How is business?\"\\n\\n\"Very dull, I am losing terribly.\"\\n\\n\"Any prospect of times brightening?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see my way out clear; but I hope there will be a change for the\\nbetter. Confidence has been greatly shaken, men of[?] business have\\ngrown exceedingly timid about investing and there is a general\\ndepression in every department of trade and business.\"\\n\\n\"Now Paul will you listen to reason and common sense? I have a\\nproposition to make. I am about to embark in a profitable business, and\\nI know that it will pay better than anything else I could undertake in\\nthese times. Men will buy liquor if they have not got money for other\\nthings. I am going to open a first class saloon, and club-house, on M.\\nStreet, and if you will join with me we can make a splendid thing of it.\\nWhy just see how well off Joe Harden is since he set up in the business;\\nand what airs he does put on! I know when he was not worth fifty\\ndollars, and kept a little low groggery on the corner of L. and S.\\nStreets, but he is out of that now--keeps a first class _Cafe_, and owns\\na block of houses. Now Paul, here is a splendid chance for you; business\\nis dull, and now accept this opening. Of course I mean to keep a first\\nclass saloon. I don\\'t intend to tolerate loafing, or disorderly conduct,\\nor to sell to drunken men. In fact, I shall put up my scale of prices so\\nthat you need fear no annoyance from rough, low, boisterous men who\\ndon\\'t know how to behave themselves. What say you, Paul?\"\\n\\n\"I say, no! I wouldn\\'t engage in such a business, not if it paid me a\\nhundred thousand dollars a year. I think these first class saloons are\\njust as great a curse to the community as the low groggeries, and I look\\nupon them as the fountain heads of the low groggeries. The man who\\nbegins to drink in the well lighted and splendidly furnished saloon is\\nin danger of finishing in the lowest dens of vice and shame.\"\\n\\n\"As you please,\" said John Anderson stiffly, \"I thought that as business\\nis dull that I would show you a chance, that would yield you a handsome\\nprofit; but if you refuse, there is no harm done. I know young men who\\nwould jump at the chance.\"\\n\\nYou may think it strange that knowing Paul Clifford as John Anderson\\ndid, that he should propose to him an interest in a drinking saloon;\\nbut John Anderson was a man who was almost destitute of faith in human\\ngoodness. His motto was that \"every man has his price,\" and as business\\nwas fairly dull, and Paul was somewhat cramped for want of capital,\\nhe thought a good business investment would be the price for Paul\\nClifford\\'s conscientious scruples.\\n\\n\"Anderson,\" said Paul looking him calmly in the face, \"you may call me\\nvisionary and impracticable; but I am determined however poor I may be,\\nnever to engage in any business on which I cannot ask God\\'s blessing.\\nAnd John I am sorry from the bottom of my heart, that you have concluded\\nto give up your grocery and keep a saloon. You cannot keep that saloon\\nwithout sending a flood of demoralizing influence over the community.\\nYour profit will be the loss of others. Young men will form in that\\nsaloon habits which will curse and overshadow all their lives. Husbands\\nand fathers will waste their time and money, and confirm themselves in\\nhabits which will bring misery, crime, and degradation; and the fearful\\noutcome of your business will be broken hearted wives, neglected\\nchildren, outcast men, blighted characters and worse than wasted lives.\\nNo not for the wealth of the Indies, would I engage in such a ruinous\\nbusiness, and I am thankful today that I had a dear sainted mother who\\ntaught me that it was better to have my hands clear than to have them\\nfull. How often would she lay her dear hands upon my head, and clasp my\\nhands in hers and say, \\'Paul, I want you to live so that you can always\\nfeel that there is no eye before whose glance you will shrink, no voice\\nfrom whose tones your heart will quail, because your hands are not\\nclean, or your record not pure,\\' and I feel glad to-day that the\\nprecepts and example of that dear mother have given tone and coloring to\\nmy life; and though she has been in her grave for many years, her memory\\nand her words are still to me an ever present inspiration.\"\\n\\n\"Yes Paul; I remember your mother. I wish! Oh well there is no use\\nwishing. But if all Christians were like her, I would have more faith in\\ntheir religion.\"\\n\\n\"But John the failure of others is no excuse for our own derelictions.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I suppose not. It is said, the way Jerusalem was kept clean,\\nevery man swept before his own door. And so you will not engage in the\\nbusiness?\"\\n\\n\"No John, no money I would earn would be the least inducement.\"\\n\\n\"How foolish,\" said John Anderson to himself as they parted. \"There is a\\nyoung man who might succeed splendidly if he would only give up some of\\nhis old fashioned notions, and launch out into life as if he had some\\ncommon sense. If business remains as it is, I think he will find out\\nbefore long that he has got to shut his eyes and swallow down a great\\nmany things he don\\'t like.\"\\n\\nAfter the refusal of Paul Clifford, John soon found a young man of\\nfacile conscience who was willing to join with him in a conspiracy of\\nsin against the peace, happiness and welfare of the community. And he\\nspared neither pains nor expense to make his saloon attractive to what\\nhe called, \"the young bloods of the city,\" and by these he meant young\\nmen whose parents were wealthy, and whose sons had more leisure and\\nspending money than was good for them. He succeeded in fitting up a\\nmagnificent palace of sin. Night after night till morning flashed the\\norient, eager and anxious men sat over the gaming table watching the\\nturn of a card, or the throw of a dice. Sparkling champaign, or\\nruby-tinted wine were served in beautiful and costly glasses. Rich\\ndivans and easy chairs invited weary men to seek repose from unnatural\\nexcitement. Occasionally women entered that saloon, but they were women\\nnot as God had made them, but as sin had debased them. Women whose\\ncostly jewels and magnificent robes were the livery of sin, the outside\\ngarnishing of moral death; the flush upon whose cheek, was not the flush\\nof happiness, and the light in their eyes was not the sparkle of\\ninnocent joy,--women whose laughter was sadder than their tears, and who\\nwere dead while they lived. In that house were wine, and mirth, and\\nrevelry, \"but the dead were there,\" men dead to virtue, true honor and\\nrectitude, who walked the streets as other men, laughed, chatted,\\nbought, sold, exchanged and bartered, but whose souls were encased in\\nliving tombs, bodies that were dead to righteousness but alive to sin.\\nLike a spider weaving its meshes around the unwary fly, John Anderson\\nwove his network of sin around the young men that entered his saloon.\\nBefore they entered there, it was pleasant to see the supple vigor and\\nradiant health that were manifested in the poise of their bodies, the\\nlightness of their eyes, the freshness of their lips and the bloom upon\\ntheir cheeks. But Oh! it was so sad to see how soon the manly gait would\\nchange to the drunkard\\'s stagger. To see eyes once bright with\\nintelligence growing vacant and confused and giving place to the\\ndrunkard\\'s leer. In many cases lassitude supplanted vigor, and sickness\\novermastered health. But the saddest thing was the fearful power that\\nappetite had gained over its victims, and though nature lifted her\\nsignals of distress, and sent her warnings through weakened nerves and\\ndisturbed functions, and although they were wasting money, time,\\ntalents, and health, ruining their characters, and alienating their\\nfriends, and bringing untold agony to hearts that loved them and yearned\\nover their defections, yet the fascination grew stronger and ever and\\nanon the grave opened at their feet; and disguise it as loving friends\\nmight, the seeds of death had been nourished by the fiery waters of\\nalcohol.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter V\\n\\n\\n[Text missing.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VI\\n\\n\\nFor a few days the most engrossing topic in A.P. was what shall I wear,\\nand what will you wear. There was an amount of shopping to be done, and\\ndressmakers to be consulted and employed before the great event of the\\nseason came off. At length the important evening arrived and in the home\\nof Mr. Glossop, a wealthy and retired whiskey dealer, there was a\\nbrilliant array of wealth and fashion. Could all the misery his liquor\\nhad caused been turned into blood, there would have been enough to have\\noozed in great drops from every marble ornament or beautiful piece of\\nfrescoe that adorned his home, for that home with its beautiful\\nsurroundings and costly furniture was the price of blood, but the glamor\\nof his wealth was in the eyes of his guests; and they came to be amused\\nand entertained and not to moralize on his ill-gotten wealth.\\n\\nThe wine flowed out in unstinted measures and some of the women so\\nforgot themselves as to attempt to rival the men in drinking. The\\nbarrier being thrown down Charles drank freely, till his tones began to\\nthicken, and his eye to grow muddled, and he sat down near Jeanette and\\ntried to converse; but he was too much under the influence of liquor to\\nhold a sensible and coherent conversation.\\n\\n\"Oh! Charley you naughty boy, that wine has got into your head and you\\ndon\\'t know what you are talking about.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Miss Jenny, I b\\'lieve you\\'re \\'bout half-right, my head does feel\\nfunny.\"\\n\\n\"I shouldn\\'t wonder; mine feels rather dizzy, and Miss Thomas has gone\\nhome with a sick headache, and I know what her headaches mean,\" said\\nJeanette significantly.\\n\\n\"My head,\" said Mary Gladstone, \"really feels as big as a bucket.\"\\n\\n\"And I feel real dizzy,\" said another.\\n\\n\"And so do I,\" said another, \"I feel as if I could hardly stand, I feel\\nawful weak.\"\\n\\n\"Why girls, you! are all, all, tipsy, now just own right up, and be done\\nwith it,\" said Charles Romaine.\\n\\n\"Why Charlie you are as good as a wizard, I believe we have all got too\\nmuch wine aboard: but we are not as bad as the girls of B.S., for they\\nsucceeded in out drinking the men. I heard the men drank eight bottles\\nof wine, and that they drank sixteen.\"\\n\\nAlas for these young people they were sporting upon the verge of a\\nprecipice, but its slippery edge was concealed by flowers. They were\\nplaying with the firebrands of death and thought they were Roman-candles\\nand harmless rockets.\\n\\n\"Good morning Belle,\" said Jeanette Roland to her cousin Belle as she\\nentered her cousin\\'s sitting-room the morning after the party and found\\nJeanette lounging languidly upon the sofa.\\n\\n\"Good morning. It is a lovely day, why are you not out enjoying the\\nfresh air? Can\\'t you put on your things and go shopping with me? I think\\nyou have excellent taste and I often want to consult it.\"\\n\\n\"Well after all then I am of some account in your eyes.\"\\n\\n\"Of course you are; who said you were not[?]\"\\n\\n\"Oh! nobody only I had an idea that you thought that I was as useless as\\na canary bird.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think that a canary bird is at all a useless thing. It charms\\nour ears with its song, and pleases our eye with its beauty, and I am a\\nfirm believer in the utility of beauty--but can you, or rather will you\\nnot go with me?\"\\n\\n\"Oh Belle I would, but I am as sleepy as a cat.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n\\n\"I was up so late last night at Mrs. Glossop\\'s party; but really it was\\na splendid affair, everything was in the richest profusion, and their\\nhouse is magnificently furnished. Oh Belle I wish you could have been\\nthere.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t; there are two classes of people with whom I never wish to\\nassociate, or number as my especial friends, and they are rum sellers\\nand slave holders.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! well, Mr. Glossop is not in the business now and what is the use of\\ntalking about the past; don\\'t be always remembering a man\\'s sins against\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"Would you say the same of a successful pirate who could fare\\nsumptuously from the effects of his piracy?\"\\n\\n\"No I would not; but Belle the cases is not at all parallel.\"\\n\\n\"Not entirely. One commits his crime against society within the pale of\\nthe law, the other commits his outside. They are both criminals against\\nthe welfare of humanity. One murders the body, and the other stabs the\\nsoul. If I knew that Mr. Glossop was sorry for having been a liquor\\ndealer and was bringing forth fruits meet for repentance, I would be\\namong the first to hail his reformation with heartfelt satisfaction; but\\nwhen I hear that while he no longer sells liquor, that he constantly\\noffers it to his guests, I feel that he should rather sit down in\\nsackcloth and ashes than fireside at sumptuous feasts, obtained by\\nliquor selling. When crime is sanctioned by law, and upheld by custom\\nand fashion, it assumes its most dangerous phase; and there is often a\\nfearful fascination in the sin that is environed by success.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Belle do stop. I really think that you will go crazy on the subject\\nof temperance. I think you must have written these lines that I have\\npicked up somewhere; let me see what they are,----\\n\\n  \"Tell me not that I hate the bowl,\\n   Hate is a feeble word.\"\\n\\n\"No Jeanette, I did not write them, but I have felt all the writer has\\nso nervously expressed. In my own sorrow-darkened home, and over my poor\\nfather\\'s grave, I learned to hate liquor in any form with all the\\nintensity of my nature.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it was a good thing you were not at Mrs. Glossop\\'s last night,\\nfor some of our heads were rather dizzy, and I know that Mr. Romaine was\\nout of gear. Now Belle! don\\'t look so shocked and pained; I am sorry I\\ntold you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I am very sorry. I had great hopes that Mr. Romaine had entirely\\ngiven up drinking, and I was greatly pained when I saw him take a glass\\nof wine at your solicitation. Jeanette I think Mr. Romaine feels a newly\\nawakened interest in you, and I know that you possess great influence\\nover him. I saw it that night when he hesitated, when you first asked\\nhim to drink, and I was so sorry to see that influence. Oh Jeanette\\ninstead of being his temptress, try and be the angel that keeps his\\nsteps. If Mr. Romaine ever becomes a drunkard and goes down to a\\ndrunkard\\'s grave, I cannot help feeling that a large measure of the\\nguilt will cling to your shirts.\"\\n\\n\"Oh Belle, do stop, or you will give me the horrors. Pa takes wine every\\nday at his dinner and I don\\'t see that he is any worse off for it. If\\nCharles Romaine can\\'t govern himself, I can\\'t see how I am to blame for\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"I think you are to blame for this Jeanette: (and pardon me if I speak\\nplainly). When Charles Romaine was trying to abstain, you tempted him to\\nbreak his resolution, and he drank to please you. I wouldn\\'t have done\\nso for my right hand.\"\\n\\n\"They say old coals are easily kindled, and I shall be somewhat chary\\nabout receiving attention from him, if you feel so deeply upon the\\nsubject.\"\\n\\n\"Jeanette you entirely misapprehend me. Because I have ceased to regard\\nMr. Romaine as a lover, does not hinder me from feeling for him as a\\nfriend. And because I am his friend and yours also, I take the liberty\\nto remonstrate against your offering him wine at your entertainments.\"\\n\\n\"Well Belle, I can\\'t see the harm in it, I don\\'t believe there was\\nanother soul who refused except you and Mr. Freeman, and you are so\\nstraightlaced, and he is rather green, just fresh from the country, it\\nwon\\'t take him long to get citified.\"\\n\\n\"Citified or countrified, I couldn\\'t help admiring his strength of\\nprinciple which stood firm in the midst of temptation and would not\\nyield to the blandishments of the hour. And so you will not go out with\\nme this morning?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! No Belle, I am too tired. Won\\'t you excuse me?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, but I must go. Good morning.\"\\n\\n\"What a strange creature my cousin Belle is,\" said Jeanette, to herself\\nas Miss Gordon left the room. \"She will never be like any one else. I\\ndon\\'t think she will ever get over my offering Mr. Romaine that glass\\nof wine, I wish she hadn\\'t seen it, but I\\'ll try and forget her and go\\nto sleep.\"\\n\\nBut Jeanette was not destined to have the whole morning for an unbroken\\nsleep. Soon after Bell\\'s departure the bell rang and Charles Romaine was\\nannounced, and weary as Jeanette was, she was too much interested in his\\nsociety to refuse him; and arraying herself in a very tasteful and\\nbecoming manner, she went down to receive him in the parlor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VII\\n\\n\\nVery pleasant was the reception Jeanette Roland gave Mr. Romaine. There\\nwas no reproof upon her lips nor implied censure in her manner. True he\\nhad been disguised by liquor or to use a softer phrase, had taken too\\nmuch wine. But others had done the same and treated it as a merry\\nescapade, and why should she be so particular? Belle Gordon would have\\nacted very differently but then she was not Belle, and in this instance\\nshe did not wish to imitate her. Belle was so odd, and had become very\\nunpopular, and besides she wished to be very very pleasant to Mr.\\nRomaine. He was handsome, agreeable and wealthy, and she found it more\\ncongenial to her taste to clasp hands with him and float down stream\\ntogether, than help him breast the current of his wrong tendencies, and\\nstand firmly on the rock of principle.\\n\\n\"You are looking very sweet, but rather pensive this morning,\" said Mr.\\nRomaine, noticing a shadow on the bright and beautiful face of Jeanette,\\nwhose color had deepened by the plain remarks of her cousin Belle. \"What\\nis the matter?\"\\n\\n\"Oh nothing much, only my cousin Belle has been here this morning, and\\nshe has been putting me on the stool of repentance.\"\\n\\n\"Why! what have you been doing that was naughty?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! she was perfectly horror-stricken when I told her about the wine we\\ndrank and Mrs. Glossop\\'s party. I wish I had not said a word to her\\nabout it.\"\\n\\n\"What did she say?\"\\n\\n\"Oh she thought it was awful, the way we were going on. She made me feel\\nthat I died [_sic_] something dreadful when I offered you a glass of\\nwine at Ma\\'s silver wedding. I don\\'t believe Belle ever sees a glass of\\nwine, without thinking of murder, suicide and a drunkard\\'s grave.\"\\n\\n\"But we are not afraid of those dreadful things, are we Jeanette?\"\\n\\n\"Of course not, but somehow Belle always makes me feel uncomfortable,\\nwhen she begins to talk on temperance. She says she is terribly in\\nearnest, and I think she is.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Gordon and I were great friends once,\" said Charles Romaine, as a\\nshadow flitted over his face, and a slight sigh escaped his lips.\\n\\n\"Were you? Why didn\\'t you remain so?\"\\n\\n\"Because she was too good for me.\"\\n\\n\"That is a very sorry reason.\"\\n\\n\"But it is true. I think Miss Gordon is an excellent young lady, but she\\nand I wouldn\\'t agree on the temperance question. The man who marries her\\nhas got to toe the mark. She ought to be a minister\\'s wife.\"\\n\\n\"I expect she will be an old maid.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, but if I were to marry her, I should prepare myself to go\\nto Church every Sunday morning and to stay home in the afternoon and\\nrepeat my catechism.\"\\n\\n\"I would like to see you under her discipline.\"\\n\\n\"It would come hard on a fellow, but I might go farther and fare worse.\"\\n\\n\"And so you and Belle were great friends, once?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but as we could not agree on the total abstinence question, we\\nparted company.\"\\n\\n\"How so? Did you part as lovers part?\"\\n\\n  She with a wronged and broken heart?\\n  And you, rejoicing you were free,\\n  Glad to regain you liberty?\\n\\n\"Not at all. She gave me the mitten and I had to take it.\"\\n\\n\"Were you very sorry?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, till I met you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Mr. Romaine,\" said Jeanette blushing and dropping her eyes.\\n\\n\"Why not? I think I have found in your society an ample compensation for\\nthe loss of Miss Gordon.\"\\n\\n\"But I think Belle is better than I am. I sometimes wish I was half so\\ngood.\"\\n\\n\"You are good enough for me; Belle is very good, but somehow her\\ngoodness makes a fellow uncomfortable. She is what I call distressingly\\ngood; one doesn\\'t want to be treated like a wild beast in a menagerie,\\nand to be every now and then stirred up with a long stick.\"\\n\\n\"What a comparison!\"\\n\\n\"Well it is a fact; when a fellow\\'s been busy all day pouring over Coke\\nand Blackstone, or casting up wearisome rows of figures, and seeks a\\nyoung lady\\'s society in the evening, he wants to enjoy himself, to bathe\\nin the sunshine of her smiles, and not to be lectured about his\\nshortcomings. I tell you, Jeanette, it comes hard on a fellow.\"\\n\\n\"You want some one to smooth the wrinkles out of the brow of care, and\\nnot to add fresh ones.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and I hope it will be my fortune to have a fair soft hand like\\nhis,\" said Mr. Romaine, slightly pressing Jeanette\\'s hand to perform the\\nwelcome and agreeable task.\\n\\n\"Belle\\'s hand would be firmer than mine for the talk.\"\\n\\n\"It is not the strong hand, but the tender hand I want in a woman.\"\\n\\n\"But Belle is very kind; she did it all for your own good.\"\\n\\n\"Of course she did; my father used to say so when I was a boy, and he\\ncorrected me; but it didn\\'t make me enjoy the correction.\"\\n\\n\"It is said our best friends are those who show us our faults, and teach\\nus how to correct them.\"\\n\\n\"My best friend is a dear, sweet girl who sits by my side, who always\\nwelcomes me with a smile, and beguiles me so with her conversation, that\\nI take no note of the hours until the striking of the clock warns me it\\nis time to leave; and I should ask no higher happiness than to be\\npermitted to pass all the remaining hours of my life at her side. Can I\\ndare to hope for such a happy fortune?\"\\n\\nA bright flush overspread the cheek of Jeanette Roland; there was a\\nsparkle of joy in her eyes as she seemed intently examining the flowers\\non her mother\\'s carpet, and she gently referred him to Papa for an\\nanswer. In due time Mr. Roland was interviewed, his consent obtained,\\nand Jeanette Roland and Charles Romaine were affianced lovers.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\"Girls, have you heard the news?\" said Miss Tabitha Jones, a pleasant\\nand wealthy spinster, to a number of young girls who were seated at her\\ntea table.\\n\\n\"No! what is it?\"\\n\\n\"I hear Mr. Romaine is to be married next spring.\"\\n\\n\"To whom?\"\\n\\n\"Jeanette Roland.\"\\n\\n\"Well! I do declare; I thought he was engaged to Belle Gordon.\"\\n\\n\"I thought so too, but it is said that she refused him, but I don\\'t\\nbelieve it; I don\\'t believe that she had a chance.\"\\n\\n\"Well I do.\"\\n\\n\"Why did she refuse him?\"\\n\\n\"Because he would occasionally take too much wine.\"\\n\\n\"But he is not a drunkard.\"\\n\\n\"But she dreads that he will be.\"\\n\\n\"Well! I think it is perfectly ridiculous. I gave Belle credit for more\\ncommon sense. I think he was one of the most eligible gentlemen in our\\nset. Wealthy, handsome and agreeable. What could have possessed Belle? I\\nthink he is perfectly splendid.\"\\n\\n\"Yes said another girl, I think Belle stood very much in her own light.\\nShe is not rich, and if she would marry him she could have everything\\nheart could wish. What a silly girl! You wouldn\\'t catch me throwing away\\nsuch a chance.\"\\n\\n\"I think,\" said Miss Tabitha, \"that instead of Miss Gordon\\'s being a\\nsilly girl, that she has acted both sensibly and honorably in refusing\\nto marry a man she could not love. No woman should give her hand where\\nshe cannot yield her heart.\"\\n\\n\"But Miss Tabitha, the strangest thing to me is, that I really believe\\nthat Belle Gordon cares more for Mr. Romaine than she does for any one\\nelse; her face was a perfect study that night at Mrs. Roland\\'s party.\"\\n\\n\"How so?\"\\n\\n\"They say that after Miss Gordon requested Mr. Romaine, that for a while\\nhe scrupulously abstained from taking even a glass of wine. At several\\nentertainments, he adhered to this purpose but on the evening of Mrs.\\nRoland\\'s silver wedding Jeanette succeeded in persuading him to take a\\nglass, in honor of the occasion. I watched Belle\\'s face and it was a\\nperfect study, every nerve seemed quivering with intense anxiety. Once I\\nthink she reached out her hand unconsciously as if to snatch away the\\nglass, and when at last he yielded I saw the light fade from her eyes, a\\ndeadly pallor overspread her cheek, and I thought at one time she was\\nabout to faint, but she did not, and only laid her head upon her side as\\nif to allay a sudden spasm of agony.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VIII\\n\\n\\nPaul Clifford sat at his ledger with a perplexed and anxious look. It\\nwas near two o\\'clock and his note was in bank. If he could not raise\\nfive hundred dollars by three o\\'clock, that note would be protested.\\nMoney was exceedingly hard to raise, and he was about despairing. Once\\nhe thought of applying to John Anderson, but he said to himself, \"No, I\\nwill not touch his money, for it is the price of blood,\" for he did not\\nwish to owe gratitude where he did not feel respect. It was now five\\nminutes past two o\\'clock and in less than an hour his note would be\\nprotested unless relief came from some unexpected quarter.\\n\\n\"Is Mr. Clifford in?\" said a full manly voice. Paul, suddenly roused\\nfrom his painful reflections, answered, \"Yes, come in. Good morning sir,\\nwhat can I do for you this morning?\"\\n\\n\"I have come to see you on business.\"\\n\\n\"I am at your service,\" said Paul.\\n\\n\"Do you remember,\" said the young man, \"of having aided an unfortunate\\nfriend more than a dozen years since by lending him five hundred\\ndollars?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I remember he was an old friend of mine, a school-mate of my\\nfather\\'s, Charles Smith.\"\\n\\n\"Well I am his son, and I have come to liquidate my father\\'s debt. Here\\nis the money with interest for twelve years.\"\\n\\nPaul\\'s heart gave a sudden bound of joy. Strong man as he was a mist\\ngathered in his eyes as he reached out his hand to receive the thrice\\nwelcome sum. He looked at the clock, it was just fifteen minutes to\\nthree.\\n\\n\"Will you walk with me to the bank or wait till I return?\"\\n\\n\"I will wait,\" said James Smith, taking up the morning paper.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\"You are just in time, Mr. Clifford,\" said the banker smiling and\\nbowing as Paul entered, \"I was afraid your note would be protested; but\\nit is all right.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Paul, \"the money market is very tight, but I think I shall\\nweather the storm.\"\\n\\n\"I hope so, you may have to struggle hard for awhile to keep your head\\nabove the water; but you must take it for your motto that there is no\\nsuch word as \\'fail.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, good morning.\"\\n\\n\"Well Mr. Smith,\" said Paul when he returned, \"your father and mine were\\nboys together. He was several years younger than my father, and a great\\nfavorite in our family among the young folks. About twelve years since\\nwhen I had just commenced business, I lent him five hundred dollars, and\\nwhen his business troubles became complicated I refused to foreclose a\\nmortgage which I had on his home. An acquaintance of mine sneered at my\\nlack of business keenness, and predicted that my money would be totally\\nlost, when I told him perhaps it was the best investment I ever made.\"\\nHe smiled incredulously and said, \"I would rather see it than hear of\\nit: but I will say that in all my business career I never received any\\nmoney that came so opportune as this. It reminds me of the stories that\\nI have read in fairy books. People so often fail in paying their own\\ndebts, it seems almost a mystery to me that you should pay a debt\\ncontracted by your father when you were but a boy.\"\\n\\n\"The clue to this mystery has been the blessed influence of my sainted\\nmother;\" and a flush of satisfaction mantled his cheek as he referred to\\nher.\\n\\n\"After my father\\'s death my mother was very poor. When she looked into\\nthe drawer there were only sixty cents in money. Of course, he had some\\npersonal property, but it was not immediately available like money, but\\nthrough the help of kind friends she was enabled to give him a\\nrespectable funeral. Like many other women in her condition of life,\\nshe had been brought up in entire ignorance of managing any other\\nbusiness, than that which belonged to her household. For years she had\\nbeen shielded in the warm clasp of loving arms, but now she had to bare\\nher breast to the storm and be father and mother both to her little\\nones. My father as you know died in debt, and he was hardly in his grave\\nwhen his creditors were upon her track. I have often heard her speak in\\nthe most grateful manner of your forbearance and kindness to her in her\\nhour of trouble. My mother went to see my father\\'s principal creditor\\nand asked him only to give her a little time to straighten out the\\ntangled threads of her business, but he was inexorable, and said that he\\nhad waited and lost by it. Very soon he had an administrator appointed\\nby the court, who in about two months took the business in his hands;\\nand my mother was left to struggle along with her little ones, and face\\nan uncertain future. These were dark days but we managed to live through\\nthem. I have often heard her say that she lived by faith and not sight,\\nthat poverty had its compensations, that there was something very sweet\\nin a life of simple trust, to her, God was not some far off and\\nunapproachable force in the universe, the unconscious Creator of all\\nconsciousness, the unperceiving author of all perception, but a Friend\\nand a Father coming near to her in sorrows, taking cognizance of her\\ngrief, and gently smoothing her path in life. But it was not only by\\nprecept that she taught us; her life was a living epistle. One morning\\nas the winter was advancing I heard her say she hoped she would be able\\nto get a nice woolen shawl, as hers was getting worse for wear. Shortly\\nafter I went out into the street and found a roll of money lying at my\\nfeet. Oh I remember it as well as if it had just occurred. How my heart\\nbounded with joy. \\'Here,\\' I said to myself, \\'is money enough to buy\\nmother a shawl and bonnet. Oh I am so glad,\\' and hurrying home I laid it\\nin her lap and said with boyish glee, \\'Hurrah for your new shawl; look\\nwhat I found in the street.\\'\"\\n\\n\"What is it my son?\" she said.\\n\\n\"Why here is money enough to buy you a new shawl and bonnet too.\" It\\nseems as if I see her now, as she looked, when she laid it aside, and\\nsaid----\\n\\n\"But James, it is not ours?\"\\n\\n\"Not ours, mother, why I found it in the street!\"\\n\\n\"Still it is not ours.\"\\n\\n\"Why mother ain`t you going to keep it?\"\\n\\n\"No my son, I shall go down to the _Clarion_ office and advertise it.\"\\n\\n\"But mother why not wait till it is advertised?\"\\n\\n\"And what then?\"\\n\\n\"If there is no owner for it, then we can keep it.\"\\n\\n\"James\" she said calmly and sadly, \"I am very sorry to see you so ready\\nto use what is not your own. I should not feel that I was dealing\\njustly, if I kept this money without endeavoring to find the owner.\"\\n\\n\"I confess that I was rather chopfallen at her decision, but in a few\\ndays after advertising we found the rightful owner. She was a very poor\\nwoman who had saved by dint of hard labor the sum of twenty dollars, and\\nwas on her way to pay the doctor who had attended her during a spell of\\nrheumatic fever, when she lost the money and had not one dollar left to\\npay for advertising and being disheartened, she had given up all hope of\\nfinding it, when she happened to see it advertised in the paper. She was\\nvery grateful to my mother for restoring the money and offered her some\\ncompensation, but she refused to take it, saying she had only done her\\nduty, and would have been ashamed of herself had she not done so. Her\\nconduct on this occasion made an impression on my mind that has never\\nbeen erased. When I grew older she explained to me about my father\\'s\\naffairs, and uncancelled debts, and I resolved that I would liquidate\\nevery just claim against him, and take from his memory even the shadow\\nof a reproach. To this end I have labored late and early; to-day I have\\npaid the last claim against him, and I am a free man.\"\\n\\n\"But how came you to find me and pay me to-day?\" \"I was purchasing in\\nJones & Brother\\'s store, when you came in to borrow money, and I heard\\nJones tell his younger brother that he was so sorry that he could not\\nhelp you, and feared that you would be ruined.\"\\n\\n\"Who is he?\" said I, \"for out West I had lost track of you.\"\\n\\n\"He is Paul Clifford, a friend of your father\\'s. Can you help him? He is\\nperfectly reliable. We would trust him with ten thousand dollars if we\\nhad it. Can you do anything for him? we will go his security, he is a\\nfine fellow and we hate to see him go under.\"\\n\\n\"Yes\" said I, \"he was one of my father\\'s creditors and I have often\\nheard my mother speak of his generosity to her little ones, and I am\\nglad that I have the privilege of helping him. I immediately went to the\\nbank had a note cashed and I am very glad if I have been of any special\\nservice to you.\"\\n\\n\"You certainly have been, and I feel that a heavy load had been lifted\\nfrom my heart.\"\\n\\nYears ago Paul Clifford sowed the seeds of kindness and they were\\nyielding him a harvest of satisfaction.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter IX\\n\\n\\nBelle Gordon\\n\\nBelle Gordon was a Christian; she had learned or tried to realize what\\nis meant by the apostle Paul when he said, \"Ye are bought with a price.\"\\nTo her those words meant the obligation she was under to her heavenly\\nFather, for the goodness and mercy that had surrounded her life, for the\\npatience that had borne with her errors and sins, and above all for the\\ngift of his dear Son, the ever blessed Christ. Faith to her was not a\\nrich traditional inheritance, a set of formulated opinions, received\\nwithout investigation, and adopted without reflection. She could not\\nbelieve because others did, and however plausible or popular a thing\\nmight be she was too conscientious to say she believed it if she did\\nnot, and when she became serious on the subject of religion it was like\\nentering into a wilderness of doubt and distress. She had been taught to\\nlook upon God, more as the great and dreadful God, than as the tender\\nloving Father of his human children, and so strong was the power of\\nassociation, that she found it hard to believe that God is good, and yet\\nuntil she could believe this there seemed to be no resting place for her\\nsoul; but in course of time the shadows were lifted from her life. Faith\\ntook the place of doubting, and in the precious promises of the Bible\\nshe felt that her soul had found a safe and sure anchorage. If others\\nbelieved because they had never doubted, she believed because she had\\ndoubted and her doubts had been dispelled by the rays of heaven, and\\nbelieving, she had entered into rest. Feeling that she was bought with a\\nprice, she realized that she was not her own, but the captive of Divine\\nLove, and that her talents were not given her to hide beneath a bushel\\nor to use for merely selfish enjoyments. That her time was not her own\\nto be frittered away by the demands of fashion or to be spent in\\nunavailing regrets. Every reform which had for its object the lessening\\nof human misery, or the increase of human happiness, found in her an\\nearnest ally. On the subject of temperance she was terribly in earnest.\\nEvery fiber of her heart responded to its onward movement. There was no\\nhut or den where human beings congregated that she felt was too vile or\\ntoo repulsive to enter, if by so doing she could help lift some fallen\\nsoul out of the depths of sin and degradation. While some doubted the\\nsoundness of her religious opinions, none doubted the orthodoxy of her\\nlife. Little children in darkened homes smiled as the sunlight of her\\npresence came over their paths; reformed men looked upon her as a loving\\ncounsellor and faithful friend and sister; women wretched and sorrowful,\\ndragged down from love and light, by the intemperance of their husbands,\\nbrought to her their heavy burdens, and by her sympathy and tender\\nconsideration she helped them bear them. She was not rich in this\\nworld\\'s goods, but she was affluent in tenderness, sympathy, and love,\\nand out of the fullness of her heart, she was a real minister of mercy\\namong the poor and degraded. Believing that the inner life developed the\\nouter, she considered the poor, and strove to awaken within them\\nself-reliance, and self-control, feeling that one of the surest ways to\\nrender people helpless or dangerous is to crush out their self-respect\\nand self-reliance. She thought it one of the greatest privileges of her\\nlife to be permitted to scatter flowers by the wayside of life. Other\\nwomen might write beautiful poems; she did more. She made her life a\\nthing of brightness and beauty.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\"Do you think she will die?\" said Belle Gordon, bending tenderly over a\\npale and fainting woman, whose face in spite of its attenuation showed\\ntraces of great beauty.\\n\\n\"Not if she is properly cared for; she has fainted from exhaustion\\nbrought on by overwork and want of proper food.\" Tears gathered in the\\neyes of Belle Gordon as she lifted the beautiful head upon her lap and\\nchafed the pale hands to bring back warmth and circulation.\\n\\n\"Let her be removed to her home as soon as possible,\" said the doctor.\\n\"The air is too heavy and damp for her.\"\\n\\n\"I wonder where she lives,\" said Belle thoughtfully, scanning her face,\\nas the features began to show[4] returning animation.\\n\\n\"Round the corner,\" said an urchin, \"she\\'s Joe Cough\\'s wife. I seed her\\ngoing down the street with a great big bundle, and Mam said, she looked\\nlike she was going to topple over.\"\\n\\n\"Where is her husband?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, I \\'spec he\\'s down to Jim Green\\'s saloon.\"\\n\\n\"What does he do?\"\\n\\n\"He don\\'t do nothing, but Mam says she works awful hard. Come this way,\"\\nsaid he with a quickness gathered by his constant contact with street\\nlife.\\n\\nUp two flights of rickety stairs they carried the wasted form of Mary\\nGough, and laid her tenderly upon a clean but very poor bed. In spite of\\nher extreme poverty there was an air of neatness in the desolate room.\\nBelle looked around and found an old tea pot in which there were a few\\nleaves. There were some dry crusts in the cupboard, while two little\\nchildren crouched by the embers in the grate, and cried for the mother.\\nBelle soon found a few coals in an old basin with which she replenished\\nthe fire, and covering up the sick woman as carefully as she could,\\nstepped into the nearest grocery and replenished her basket with some of\\ngood the things of life.\\n\\n\"Is it not too heavy for you[r] might?\" said Paul Clifford from whose\\ngrocery Belle had bought her supplies.\\n\\n\"Can I not send them home for you?\"\\n\\n\"No I don\\'t want them sent home. They are for a poor woman and her\\nsuffering children, who live about a square from here in Lear\\'s Court.\"\\nPaul stood thoughtfully a moment before handing her the basket, and\\nsaid--\"That court has a very bad reputation; had I not better accompany\\nyou? I hope you will not consider my offer as an intrusion, but I do not\\nthink it is safe for you to venture there alone.\"\\n\\n\"If you think it is not safe I will accept of your company; but I never\\nthought of danger for myself in the presence of that fainting woman and\\nher hungry children. Do you know her? Her name is Mrs. Gough.\" \"I think\\nI do. If it is the person I mean, I remember her when she was as\\nlighthearted and happy a girl as I ever saw, but she married against her\\nparents\\' consent, a worthless fellow named Joe Gough, and in a short\\ntime she disappeared from the village and I suppose she has come home,\\nbroken in health and broken in spirit.\"\\n\\n\"And I am afraid she has come home to die. Are her parents still alive?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but her father never forgave her. Her mother I believe would take\\nher to her heart as readily as she ever did, but her husband has an iron\\nwill and she has got to submit to him.\"\\n\\n\"Where do they live?\"\\n\\n\"At No 200 Rouen St. but here we are at the door.\" Paul carried the\\nbasket up stairs, and sat down quietly, while Belle prepared some\\nrefreshing tea and toast for the feeble mother; and some bread and milk\\nfor the hungry children.\\n\\n\"What shall I do?\" said Belle looking tenderly upon the wan face, \"I\\nhate to leave her alone and yet I confess I do not prefer spending the\\nnight here.\"\\n\\n\"Of course not,\" said Paul looking thoughtfully into the flickering fire\\nof the grate.\\n\\n\"Oh! I have it now; I know a very respectable woman who occasionally\\ncleans out my store. Just wait a few moments, and I think I can find\\nher,\" said Paul Clifford turning to the door. In a short time he\\nreturned bringing with him a pleasant looking woman whose face in spite\\nof the poverty of her dress had a look of genuine refinement which comes\\nnot so much from mingling with people of culture as from the culture of\\nher own moral and spiritual nature. She had learned to \"look up and not\\nto look down.\" To lend a helping hand wherever she felt it was needed.\\nHer life was spent in humble usefulness. She was poor in this world\\'s\\ngoods, but rich in faith and good works. No poor person who asked her\\nfor bread ever went away empty. Sometimes people would say, \"I wouldn\\'t\\ngive him a mouthful; he is not worthy,\" and then she would say in the\\ntenderest and sweetest manner:\\n\\n\"Suppose our heavenly Father only gave to us because we are worthy; what\\nwould any of us have?\" I know she once said of a miserable sot with whom\\nshe shared her scanty food, that he is a wretched creature, but I wanted\\nto get at his heart, and the best way to it was through his stomach. I\\nnever like to preach religion to hungry people. There is something very\\nbeautiful about the charity of the poor, they give not as the rich of\\ntheir abundance, but of their limited earnings, gifts which when given\\nin a right spirit bring a blessing with them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter X\\n\\n\\nMary Gough\\n\\n\"I think,\" said Paul Clifford to Miss Gordon, \"that I have found just\\nthe person that will suit you, and if you accept I will be pleased to\\nsee you safe home.\" Belle thanked the young grocer, and gratefully\\naccepted his company.\\n\\nBelle returned the next day to see her protege and found her getting\\nalong comfortably although she could not help seeing it was sorrow more\\nthan disease that was sapping her life, and drying up the feeble streams\\nof existence.\\n\\n\"How do you feel this morning?\" said Belle laying her hand tenderly upon\\nher forehead.\\n\\n\"Better, much better,\" she replied with an attempt at cheerfulness in\\nher voice. \"I am so glad, that Mother Graham is here. It is like letting\\nthe sunshine into these gloomy rooms to have her around. It all seems\\nlike a dream to me, I remember carrying a large bundle of work to the\\nstore, that my employer spoke harshly to me and talked of cutting down\\nmy wages. I also remember turning into the street, my eyes almost\\nblinded with tears, and that I felt a dizziness in my head. The next I\\nremember was seeing a lady feeding my children, and a gentleman coming\\nin with Aunty Graham.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Belle, \"fortunately after I had seen you, I met with Mr.\\nClifford who rendered me every necessary assistance. His presence was\\nvery opportune,\" just then Belle turned her eyes toward the door and saw\\nMr. Clifford standing on the threshold.\\n\\n\"Ah,\" said he smiling and advancing \"this time the old adage has\\nfailed, which says that listeners never hear any good of themselves; for\\nwithout intending to act the part of an eavesdropper, I heard myself\\npleasantly complimented.\"\\n\\n\"No more than you deserve,\" said Belle smiling and blushing, as she gave\\nhim her hand in a very frank and pleasant manner. \"Mrs. Gough is much\\nbetter this morning and is very grateful to you for your kindness.\"\\n\\n\"Mine,\" said Mr. Clifford \"if you, will call it so, was only the result\\nof an accident. Still I am very glad if I have been of any service, and\\nyou are perfectly welcome to make demands upon me that will add to Mrs.\\nCough\\'s comfort.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, I am very glad she has found a friend in you. It is such a\\nblessed privilege to be able to help others less fortunate than\\nourselves.\"\\n\\n\"It certainly is.\"\\n\\n\"Just a moment,\" said Belle, as the voice of Mrs. Gough fell faintly on\\nher ear.\\n\\n\"What is it, dear?\" said Belle bending down to catch her words. \"Who is\\nthat gentleman? His face and voice seem familiar.\"\\n\\n\"It is Mr. Clifford.\"\\n\\n\"Paul Clifford?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. Do you know him?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I knew him years ago when I was young and happy; but it seems an\\nage since. Oh, isn\\'t it a dreadful thing, to be a drunkard\\'s wife?\"\\n\\n\"Yes it is, but would you like to speak to Mr. Clifford?\"\\n\\n\"Yes! Mam, I would.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Clifford,\" said Belle, \"Mrs. Gough would like to speak with you.\"\\n\\n\"Do you not know me?\" said Mary, looking anxiously into his face.\\n\\n\"I recognized you as soon as you moved into the neighborhood.\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad. I feared that I was so changed that my own dear mother\\nwould hardly recognize me. Don\\'t you think she would pity and forgive\\nme, if she saw what a mournful wretch I am?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I think she has long forgiven you and longs to take you to her\\nheart as warmly as she ever did.\"\\n\\n\"And my father?\"\\n\\n\"I believe he would receive you, but I don\\'t think he would be willing\\nto recognize your husband. You know he is very set in his ways.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Clifford, I feel that my days are numbered and that my span of life\\nwill soon be done; but while I live I feel it my duty to cling to my\\ndemented husband, and to do all I can to turn him from the error of his\\nways. But I do so wish that my poor children could have my mother\\'s\\ncare, when I am gone. If I were satisfied on that score, I would die\\ncontent.\"\\n\\n\"Do not talk of dying,\" said Belle taking the pale thin hand in hers.\\n\"You must try and live for your children\\'s sake. When you get strong I\\nthink I can find you some work among my friends. There is Mrs. Roberts,\\nshe often gives out work and I think I will apply to her.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. James Roberts on St. James St. near 16th?\"\\n\\n\"Yes! do you know her?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Gough closing her eyes wearily, \"I know her and have\\nworked for her.\"\\n\\n\"I think she is an excellent woman, I remember one morning we were\\ntalking together on religious experience, and about women speaking in\\nclass and conference meetings. I said I did not think I should like to\\nconstantly relate my experience in public, there was often such a lack\\nof assurance of faith about me that I shrank from holding up my inner\\nlife to inspection; and she replied that she would always say that she\\nloved Jesus, and I thought Oh, how I would like to have her experience.\\nWhat rest and peace I would have if I could feel that I was always in\\nharmony with Him.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Belle I hope you will not be offended with me, for I am very\\nignorant about these matters; but there was something about Mrs. Roberts\\ndealings with us poor working people, that did seem to me not to be just\\nwhat I think religion calls for. I found her a very hard person to deal\\nwith; she wanted so much work for so little money.\"\\n\\n\"But, Mrs. Gough, the times are very hard; and the rich feel it as well\\nas the poor.\"\\n\\n\"But not so much. It curtails them in their luxuries, and us in our\\nnecessities; perhaps I shouldn\\'t mention, but after my husband had\\nbecome a confirmed drunkard, and all hope had died out of my heart, I\\nhadn\\'t time to sit down and brood helplessly over my misery. I had to\\nstruggle for my children and if possible keep the wolf from the door;\\nand besides food and clothing, I wanted to keep my children in a\\nrespectable neighborhood, and my whole soul rose up in revolt against\\nthe idea of bringing them up where their eyes and ears would be\\nconstantly smitten by improper sights and sounds. While I was worrying\\nover my situation and feeling that my health was failing under the\\nterrible pressure of care and overwork, Mrs. Roberts brought me work;\\n\\'What will you do this for,\\' she said, displaying one of the articles\\nshe wanted made. I replied,\\'One dollar and twenty-five cents,\\' and I\\nknew the work well worth it. \\'I can get it done for one dollar,\\' she\\nreplied, \\'and I am not willing to give any more.\\' What could I do? I was\\nout of work, my health was poor, and my children clutching at my heart\\nstrings for bread; and so I took it at her price. It was very\\nunprofitable, but it was better than nothing.\"\\n\\n\"Why that is very strange. I know she pays her dressmaker handsomely.\"\\n\\n\"That is because her dressmaker is in a situation to dictate her own\\nterms; but while she would pay her a large sum for dressmaking, she\\nwould screw and pinch a five-cent piece from one who hadn\\'t power to\\nresist her demands. I have seen people save twenty-five or fifty cents\\nin dealing with poor people, who would squander ten times as much on\\nsome luxury of the table or wardrobe. I[?] often find that meanness and\\nextravagance go hand in hand.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that is true, still Mrs. Gough, I think people often act like Mrs.\\nRoberts more from want of thought than want of heart. It was an old\\ncharge brought against the Israelite, \\'My people doth not consider.\\'\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\"What is the matter, my dear?\" said Belle a few mornings after this\\nconversation as she approached the bedside of Mary Gough, \"I thought you\\nwere getting along so nicely, and that with proper care you would be on\\nyour feet in a few days, but this morning you look so feeble, and seem\\nso nervous and depressed. Do tell me what has happened and what has\\nbecome of your beautiful hair; oh you had such a wealth of tresses, I\\nreally loved to toy with them. Was your head so painful that the doctor\\nordered them to be cut?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no,\" she said burying her face in the pillow and breaking into a\\nparoxysm of tears. \"Oh, Miss Belle, how can I tell you,\" she replied\\nrecovering from her sudden outburst of sorrow.\\n\\n\"Why, what is it darling? I am at a loss to know what has become of your\\nbeautiful hair.\"\\n\\nWith gentle womanly tact Belle saw that the loss of her hair was a\\nsubject replete with bitter anguish, and turning to the children she\\ntook them in her lap and interested and amused them by telling beautiful\\nfairy stories. In a short time Mary\\'s composure returned, and she said,\\n\"Miss Belle, I can now tell you how I lost my hair. Last night my\\nhusband, or the wreck of what was once my husband, came home. His eyes\\nwere wild and bloodshot; his face was pale and haggard, his gait uneven,\\nand his hand trembling. I have seen him suffering from _Manipaotu_ and\\ndreaded lest he should have a returning of it. Mrs. Graham had just\\nstepped out, and there was no one here but myself and children. He held\\nin his hand a pair of shears, and approached my bedside. I was ready to\\nfaint with terror, when he exclaimed, \\'Mary I must have liquor or I\\nshall go wild,\\' he caught my hair in his hand; I was too feeble to\\nresist, and in a few minutes he had cut every lock from my head, and\\nleft it just as you see it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, what a pity, and what a shame.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Miss Gordon do you think the men who make our laws ever stop to\\nconsider the misery, crime and destruction that flow out of the liquor\\ntraffic? I have done all I could to induce him to abstain, and he has\\nabstained several months at a time and then suddenly like a flash of\\nlightning the temptation returns and all his resolutions are scattered\\nlike chaff before the wind. I have been blamed for living with him, but\\nMiss Belle were you to see him in his moments of remorse, and hear his\\nbitter self reproach, and his earnest resolutions to reform, you would\\nas soon leave a drowning man to struggle alone in the water as to\\nforsake him in his weakness when every one else has turned against him,\\nand if I can be the means of saving him, the joy for his redemption will\\ncounterbalance all that I have suffered as a drunkard\\'s wife.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XI\\n\\n\\n[Text missing.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XII\\n\\n\\n[Text missing.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XIII\\n\\n\\nJohn Anderson\\'s Saloon\\n\\n  _\"The end of these things is death.\"_\\n\\n\"Why do you mix that liquor with such care and give it to that child?\\nYou know he is not going to pay you for it?\"\\n\\n\"I am making an investment.\"\\n\\n\"How so?\"\\n\\n\"Why you see that boy\\'s parents are very rich, and in course of time he\\nwill be one of my customers.\"\\n\\n\"Well! John Anderson as old a sinner as I am, I wouldn\\'t do such a thing\\nfor my right hand.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s the harm? You are one of my best customers, did liquor ever harm\\nyou?\"\\n\\n\"Yes it does harm me, and when I see young men beginning to drink, I\\nfeel like crying out, \\'Young man you are in danger, don\\'t put your feet\\nin the terrible flood, for ten to one you will be swamped.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Well! this is the best joke of the season: Tom Cary preaching\\ntemperance. When do you expect to join the Crusade? But, Oh! talk is\\ncheap.\"\\n\\n\"Cheap or dear, John Anderson, when I saw you giving liquor to that\\ninnocent boy, I couldn\\'t help thinking of my poor Charley. He was just\\nsuch a bright child as that, with beautiful brown eyes, and a fine\\nforehead. Ah that boy had a mind; he was always ahead in his studies.\\nBut once when he was about twelve years old, I let him go on a\\ntravelling tour with his uncle. He was so agreeable and wide awake, his\\nuncle liked to have him for company; but it was a dear trip to my poor\\nCharley. During this journey they stopped at a hotel, and my brother\\ngave him a glass of wine. Better for my dear boy had he given him a\\nglass of strychnine. That one glass awakened within him a dreadful\\ncraving. It raged like a hungry fire. I talked to him, his mother pled\\nwith him, but it was no use, liquor was his master, and when he couldn\\'t\\nget liquor I\\'ve known him to break into his pantry to get our burning\\nfluid to assuage his thirst. Sometimes he would be sober for several\\nweeks at a time, and then our hopes would brighten that Charley would be\\nhimself again, and then in an hour all our hopes would be dashed to the\\nground. It seemed as if a spell was upon him. He married a dear good\\ngirl, who was as true as steel, but all her entreaties for him to give\\nup drinking were like beating the air. He drank, and drank, until he\\ndrank himself into the grave.\"\\n\\nBy this time two or three loungers had gathered around John Anderson and\\nThomas Gary, and one of them said, \"Mr. Gary you have had sad\\nexperience, why don\\'t you give up drinking yourself?\"\\n\\n\"Give it up! because I can\\'t. To-day I would give one half of my farm if\\nI could pass by this saloon and not feel that I wanted to come in. No, I\\nfeel that I am a slave. There was a time when I could have broken my\\nchain, but it is too late now, and I say young men take warning by me\\nand don\\'t make slaves and fools of yourselves.\"\\n\\n\"Now, Tom Cary,\" said John Anderson, \"it is time for you to dry up, we\\nhave had enough of this foolishness, if you can\\'t govern yourself, the\\nmore\\'s the pity for you.\"\\n\\nJust then the newsboy came along crying: _\"Evening Mail. All about the\\ndreadful murder! John Coots and James Loraine. Last edition. Buy a\\npaper, Sir! Here\\'s your last edition, all \\'bout the dreadful murder\"._\\n\\n\"John Coots,\" said several voices all at once, \"Why he\\'s been here a\\nhalf dozen times today.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve drank with him,\" said one, \"at that bar twice since noon. He had a\\nstrange look out of his eyes; and I heard him mutter something to\\nhimself.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said another, \"I heard him say he was going to kill somebody,\\n\\'one or the other\\'s got to die,\\' what does the paper say?\"\\n\\n\"LOVE, JEALOUSY, AND MURDER.\"\\n\\n\"The old story,\" said Anderson, looking somewhat relieved, \"A woman\\'s at\\nthe bottom of it.\"\\n\\n\"And liquor,\" said Tom Cary, \"is at the top of it.\"\\n\\n\"I wish you would keep a civil tongue in your head,\" said Anderson,\\nscowling at Cary.\\n\\n\"Oh! never mind; Tom, will have his say. He\\'s got a knack of speaking\\nout in meeting.\"\\n\\n\"And a very disagreeable knack it is.\"\\n\\n\"Oh never mind about Tom, read about the murder, and tend to Tom some\\nother time.\"\\n\\nEagerly and excitedly they read the dreadful news. A woman, frail and\\nvicious, was at the bottom; a woman that neither of those men would have\\nmarried as a gracious gift, was the guilty cause of one murder, and when\\nthe law would take its course, two deaths would lie at her door. Oh, the\\nfolly of some men, who, instead of striving to make home a thing of\\nbeauty, strength and grace, wander into forbidden pastures, and reap for\\nthemselves harvests of misery and disgrace. And all for what? Because of\\nthe allurements of some idle, vain and sinful woman who has armed\\nherself against the peace, the purity and the progress of the fireside.\\nSuch women are the dry rot in the social fabric; they dig in the dark\\nbeneath the foundation stones of the home. Young men enter their houses,\\nand over the mirror of their lives, comes the shadow of pollution.\\nCompanionship with them unprepares them for the pure, simple joys of a\\nhappy and virtuous home; a place which should be the best school for the\\naffections; one of the fairest spots on earth and one of the brightest\\ntypes of heaven. Such a home as this, may exist without wealth, luxury\\nor display; but it cannot exist without the essential elements of\\npurity, love and truth.\\n\\nThe story was read, and then came the various comments.\\n\\n\"Oh, it was dreadful,\" said one. \"Mr. Loraine belongs to one of the\\nfirst families in the town; and what a cut it will be to them, not\\nsimply that he has been murdered, but murdered where he was--in the\\nhouse of Lizzie Wilson. I knew her before she left husband and took to\\nevil courses.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, what a pity, I expect it will almost kill his wife, poor thing, I\\npity her from the bottom of my heart.\"\\n\\n\"Why what\\'s the matter Harry Richards? You look as white as a sheet, and\\nyou are all of a tremor.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve just come from the coroner\\'s inquest, had to be one of the\\nwitnesses. I am afraid it will go hard with Coots.\"\\n\\n\"Why? What was the verdict of the jury?\"\\n\\n\"They brought in a verdict of death by killing at the hands of John\\nCoots.\"\\n\\n\"Were you present at the murder?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"How did it happen?\"\\n\\n\"Why you see John had been spending his money very freely on Lizzie\\nWilson, and he took it into his head because Loraine had made her some\\ncostly presents, that she had treated him rather coolly and wanted to\\nship him, and so he got dreadfully put out with Loraine and made some\\nbitter threats against him. But I don\\'t believe he would have done the\\ndeed if he had been sober, but he\\'s been on a spree for several days and\\nhe was half crazy when he did it. Oh it was heartrending to see\\nLoraine\\'s wife when they brought him home a corpse. She gave an awful\\nshriek and fell to the floor, stiff as a poker; and his poor little\\nchildren, it made my heart bleed to look at them; and his poor old\\nmother. I am afraid it will be the death of her.\"\\n\\nIn a large city with its varied interests, one event rapidly chases the\\nother. Life-boats are stranded on the shores of time, pitiful wrecks of\\nhumanity are dashed amid the rocks and reefs of existence. Old faces\\ndisappear and new ones take their places and the stream of life ever\\nhurries on to empty where death\\'s waters meet.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAt the next sitting of the Court John Coots was arraigned, tried, and\\nconvicted of murder in the first degree. His lawyer tried to bring in a\\nplea of emotional insanity but failed. If insane he was insane through\\nthe influence of strong drink. It was proven that he had made fierce\\nthreats against the life of Loraine, and the liquor in which he had so\\nfreely indulged had served to fire his brain and nerve his hand to carry\\nout his wicked intent; and so the jury brought in its verdict, and he\\nwas sentenced to be executed, which sentence was duly performed and that\\nclosed another act of the sad drama. Intemperance and Sensuality had\\nclasped hands together, and beneath their cruel fostering the gallows\\nhad borne its dreadful fruit of death. The light of one home had been\\nquenched in gloom and guilt. A husband had broken over the barriers that\\nGod placed around the path of marital love, and his sun had gone down at\\nmid-day. The sun which should have gilded the horizon of life and lent\\nit additional charms, had gone down in darkness, yes, set behind the\\nshadow of a thousand clouds. Innocent and unoffending childhood was\\nrobbed of a father\\'s care, and a once happy wife, and joyful mother sat\\ndown in her widow\\'s weeds with the mantle of a gloomier sorrow around\\nher heart. And all for what? Oh who will justify the ways of God to man?\\nWho will impress upon the mind of youth with its impulsiveness that it\\nis a privilege as well as a duty to present the body to God, as a living\\nsacrifice holy and acceptable in his sight. That God gives man no law\\nthat is not for his best advantage, and that the interests of humanity,\\nand the laws of purity and self-denial all lie in the same direction,\\nand the man who does not take care of his body must fail to take the\\nbest care of his soul; for the body should be temple for God\\'s holy\\nspirit and the instrument to do his work, and we have no right to defile\\nthe one or blunt the other and thus render ourselves unfit for the\\nMaster\\'s service.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XIV\\n\\n\\nBelle Gordon\\'s indignation was thoroughly aroused by hearing Mary\\nGough\\'s story about the loss of her hair, and she made up her mind that\\nwhen she saw Joe Gough she would give him a very plain talking.\\n\\n\"I would like to see your husband; I would just like to tell him what I\\nthink about his conduct.\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said Mary, her pale cheek growing whiter with apprehension;\\n\"That\\'s his footsteps now, Miss Belle don\\'t say anything to him, Joe\\'s\\nas good and kind a man as I ever saw when he is sober, but sometimes he\\nis really ugly when he has been drinking.\"\\n\\nJust then the door was opened, and Joe Gough entered, or rather all that\\nremained of the once witty, talented and handsome Josiah Gough. His face\\nwas pale and haggard, and growing premature by age, his wealth of raven\\nhair was unkempt and hung in tangled locks over his forehead, his hand\\nwas unsteady and trembling from extreme nervousness, but he was sober\\nenough to comprehend the situation, and to feel a deep sense of remorse\\nand shame, when he gazed upon the weary head from whence he had bereft\\nits magnificent covering.\\n\\n\"Here Mary,\" said he approaching the bed, \"I\\'ve brought you a present; I\\nonly had four cents, and I thought this would please you, I know you\\nwomen are so fond of jew-gaws,\" and he handed [her] a pair of sleeve\\nbuttons.\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said she, as a faint smile illuminated her pallid cheek.\\n\"This,\" she said turning to Miss Gordon, \"is my husband, Josiah Gough.\"\\n\\n\"Good morning, Mr. Gough,\" said Belle bowing politely and extending her\\nhand. Joe returned the salutation very courteously and very quietly,\\nsitting down by the bedside, made some remarks about the dampness of the\\nweather. Mary lay very quiet, looking pitifully upon the mour[n]ful\\nwretch at her side, who seemed to regard her and her friend with intense\\ninterest. It seemed from his countenance that remorse and shame were\\nrousing up his better nature. Once he rose as if to go--stood\\nirresolutely for a moment, and then sitting down by the bedside, clasped\\nher thin pale hand in his with a caressing motion, and said, \"Mary\\nyou\\'ve had a hard time, but I hope there are better days in store for\\nus, don\\'t get out of heart,\" and there was a moisture in his eyes in\\nwhich for a moment beamed a tender, loving light. Belle immediately felt\\nher indignation changing to pity. Surely she thought within herself,\\nthis man is worth saving--There is still love and tenderness within him,\\nnotwithstanding all his self-ruin, he reminds me of an expression I have\\npicked up somewhere about \"Old Oak,\" holding the young fibres at its\\nheart, I will appeal to that better nature, I will use it as a lever to\\nlift him from the depths into which he has fallen. While she was\\nthinking of the best way to approach him, and how to reach that heart\\ninto whose hidden depths she had so unexpectedly glanced, he arose and\\nbending over his wife imprinted upon her lips a kiss in which remorse\\nand shame seemed struggling for expression, and left the room.\\n\\n\"Mother Graham,\" said Belle, \"a happy thought has just struck me,\\nCouldn\\'t we induce Mr. Gough to attend the meeting of the Reform Club?\\nMr. R.N. speaks tonight and he has been meeting with glorious success as\\na Temperance Reformer, hundreds of men, many of them confirmed\\ndrunkards, have joined, and he is doing a remarkable work, he does not\\nwait for the drunkards to come to him, he goes to them, and wins them by\\nhis personal sympathy, and it is wonderful the good he has done, I do\\nwish he would go.\"\\n\\n\"I wish so too,\" said Martha Graham.\\n\\n\"If he should not return while I am here will you invite him to attend?\\nPerhaps Mrs. Gough can spare you an hour or two this evening to\\naccompany him.\"\\n\\n\"That I would gladly do, I think it would do me more good than all the\\nmedicines you could give me, to see my poor husband himself once more.\\nBefore he took to drinking, I was so happy, but it seems as if since\\nthen I have suffered sorrow by the spoonful. Oh the misery that this\\ndrink causes. I do hope these reform clubs will be the means of shutting\\nup every saloon in the place, for just as long as one of them is open he\\nis in danger.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Belle, \"what we need is not simply to stop the men from\\ndrinking, but to keep the temptation out of their way.\"\\n\\n\"Joe,\" said Mary, \"belongs to a good family, he has a first-rate\\neducation, is a fine penman, and a good bookkeeper, but this dreadful\\ndrink has thrown him out of some of the best situations in the town\\nwhere we were living.\"\\n\\n\"Oh what a pity, I heard Mr. Clifford say that his business was\\nincreasing so that he wanted a good clerk and salesman to help him, that\\nhe was overworked and crippled for want of sufficient help. Maybe if\\nyour husband would sign the pledge, Mr. Clifford would give him a trial,\\nbut it is growing late and I must go. I would liked to have seen your\\nhusband before I left, and have given him a personal invitation, but you\\nand Mother Graham can invite him for me, so good bye, keep up a good\\nheart, you know where to cast your burden.\"\\n\\nJust as Miss Gordon reached the landing, she saw Joe Gough standing at\\nthe outer door and laying her hand gently upon his shoulder, exclaimed,\\n\"Oh Mr. Gough, I am so glad to see you again, I wanted to invite you to\\nattend a temperance meeting tonight at Amory Hall. Will you go?\"\\n\\n\"Well I don\\'t like to promise,\" he replied, looking down upon his seedy\\ncoat and dilapidated shoes.\\n\\n\"Never mind your wardrobe,\" said Miss Gordon divining his thoughts.\\n\"The soul is more than raiment, \\'the world has room for another man and\\nI want you to fill the place.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said he, \"I\\'ll come.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, I expect to be there and will look for you. Come early and\\nbring Mother Graham.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Gough can spare her an hour or two this evening, I think your wife\\nis suffering more from exhaustion and debility than anything else.\"\\n\\n\"Yes poor Mary has had a hard time, but it shan\\'t be always so. As soon\\nas I get work I mean to take her out of this,\" said he looking\\ndisdainfully at the wretched tenement house, with its broken shutters\\nand look of general decay.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\"Why Mother Graham is [the] meeting over? You must have had a fine time,\\nyou just look delighted. Did Joe go in with you, and where is he now?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, he went with me, listened to the speeches, and joined the club, I\\nsaw him do it with my own eyes, Oh, we had a glorious time!\"\\n\\n\"Oh I am so glad,\" said Mary, her eyes filling with sudden tears. \"I do\\nhope he will keep his pledge!\"\\n\\n\"I hope so too, and I hope he will get something to do. Mr. Clifford was\\nthere when he signed, and Miss Belle was saying today that he wanted a\\nclerk that would be a first r[at]e place for Joe, if he will only keep\\nhis pledge. Mr. Clifford is an active temperance man, and I believe\\nwould help to keep Joe straight.\"\\n\\n\"I hope he\\'ll get the place, but Mother Graham, tell me all about the\\nmeeting, you don\\'t know how happy I am.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t I deary? Have I been through it all, but it seems as if I had\\npassed through suffering into peace, but never mind Mother Graham\\'s past\\ntroubles, let me tell you about the meeting.\"\\n\\n\"At these meetings quite a number of people speak, just as we went in\\none of the speakers was telling his experience, and what a terrible\\nstruggle he had to overcome the power of appetite. Now when he felt the\\nfearful craving coming over him he would walk the carpet till he had\\nactually worn it threadbare; but that he had been converted and found\\ngrace to help him in time of need, and how he had gone out and tried to\\nreform others and had seen the work prosper in his hand. I watched Joe\\'s\\nface, it seemed lit up with earnestness and hope, as if that man had\\nbrought him a message of deliverance; then after the meeting came the\\nsigning of the pledge and joining the reform club, and it would have\\ndone you good to see the men that joined.\"\\n\\n\"Do you remember Thomas Allison?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, poor fellow, and I think if any man ever inherited drunkenness, he\\ndid, for his father and his mother were drunkards before him.\"\\n\\n\"Well, he joined and they have made him president of the club.\"\\n\\n\"Well did I ever! But tell me all about Joe.\"\\n\\n\"When the speaking was over, Joe sat still and thoughtful as if making\\nup his mind, when Miss Gordon came to him and asked him to join, he\\nstopped a minute to button his coat and went right straight up and had\\nhis name put down, but oh how the people did clap and shout. Well as Joe\\nwas one of the last to sign, the red ribbons they use for badges was all\\ngone and Joe looked so sorry, he said he wanted to take a piece of\\nribbon home to let his wife know that he belonged to the Reform Club,\\nMiss Gordon heard him, and she had a piece of black lace and red ribbon\\ntwisted together around her throat and she separated the lace from the\\nribbon and tied it in his button-hole, so his Mary would see it. Oh Miss\\nBelle did look so sweet and Mr. Clifford never took his eyes off her. I\\nthink he admires her very much.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see how he can help it, she is one of the dearest--sweetest,\\nladies I ever saw, she never seemed to say by her actions, \\'I am doing\\nso much for you poor people\\' and you can\\'t be too thankful.\"\\n\\n\"Not she, and between you and I, and the gate-post, I think that will be\\na match.\"\\n\\n\"I think it would make a splendid one, but hush, I hear some persons\\ncoming.\"\\n\\nThe door opened and Paul Clifford, Joe Gough, and Belle Gordon entered.\\n\\n\"Here Mrs. Gough,\" said Paul Clifford, \"as we children used to say.\\nHere\\'s your husband safe and sound, and I will add, a member of our\\nreformed club and we have come to congratulate you upon the event.\"\\n\\n\"My dear friends, I am very thankful to you for your great kindness, I\\ndon\\'t think I shall ever be able to repay you.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be uneasy darling,\" said Belle, \"we are getting our pay as we go\\nalong, we don\\'t think the cause of humanity owes us anything.\" \"Yes,\"\\nsaid Joe seating himself by the bed side with an air of intense\\ngratification. \"Here is my badge, I did not want to leave the meeting\\nwithout having this to show you.\"\\n\\n\"This evening,\" said Mrs. Gough smiling through her tears, \"reminds me\\nof a little temperance song I learned when a child, I think it commenced\\nwith these words:\\n\\n \"And are you sure the news is true?\\n  Are you sure my John has joined?\\n  I can\\'t believe the happy news,\\n  And leave my fears behind,\\n  If John has joined and drinks no more,\\n  The happiest wife am I\\n  That ever swept a cabin floor,\\n  Or sung a lullaby.\\n\\n\"That\\'s just the way I feel to-night, I haven\\'t been so happy before for\\nyears.\"\\n\\n\"And I hope,\" said Mr. Clifford, \"that you will have many happy days\\nand nights in the future.\"\\n\\n\"And I hope so too,\" said Joe, shaking hands with Paul and Belle as they\\nrose to go.\\n\\nMr. Clifford accompanied Belle to her door, and as they parted she said,\\n\"This is a glorious work in which it is our privilege to clasp hands.\"\\n\\n\"It is and I hope,\" but as the words rose to his lips, he looked into\\nthe face of Belle, and it was so radiant with intelligent tenderness and\\njoy, that she seemed to him almost like a glorified saint, a being too\\nprecious high and good for common household uses, and so the remainder\\nof the sentence died upon his lips and he held his peace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XV\\n\\n\\n\"I have resolved to dissolve partnership with Charles,\" said Augustine\\nRomaine to his wife, the next morning after his son\\'s return from the\\nChampaign supper at John Anderson\\'s.\\n\\n\"Oh! no you are not in earnest, are you? You seem suddenly to have lost\\nall patience with Charlie.\"\\n\\n\"Yes I have, and I have made up my mind that I am not going to let him\\nhang like a millstone on our business. No, if he will go down, I am\\ndetermined he shall not drag me down with him. See what a hurt it would\\nbe to us, to have it said, \\'Don\\'t trust your case with the Romaine\\'s for\\nthe Junior member of that firm is a confirmed drunkard.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Well, Augustine you ought to know best, but it seems like casting him\\noff, to dissolve partnership with him.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t help it, if he persists in his downward course he must take the\\nconsequences. Charles has had every advantage; when other young lawyers\\nhave had to battle year after year with obscurity and poverty, he\\nentered into a business that was already established and flourishing.\\nWhat other men were struggling for, he found ready made to his hand, and\\nif he chooses to throw away every advantage and make a complete wreck of\\nhimself, I can\\'t help it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! it does seem so dreadful, I wonder what will become of my poor\\nboy?\"\\n\\n\"Now, mother I want you to look at this thing in the light of reason and\\ncommon sense. I am not turning Charles out of the house. He is not poor,\\nthough the way he is going on he will be. You know his grandfather has\\nleft him a large estate out West, which is constantly increasing in\\nvalue. Now what I mean to do is to give Charles a chance to set up for\\nhimself as attorney, wherever he pleases. Throwing him on his own\\nresources, with a sense of responsibility, may be the best thing for\\nhim; but in the present state of things I do not think it advisable to\\ncontinue our business relations together. For more than twenty-five\\nyears our firm has stood foremost at the bar. Ever since my brother and\\nI commenced business together our reputation has been unspotted and I\\nmean to keep it so, if I have to cut off my right hand.\"\\n\\nMrs. Romaine gazed upon the stern sad face of her husband, and felt by\\nthe determination of his manner that it was useless to entreat or reason\\nwith him to change his purpose; and so with a heavy heart, and eyes\\ndrooping with unshed tears, she left the room.\\n\\n\"John,\" said Mr. Romaine to the waiter, \"tell Charles I wish to see him\\nbefore I go down to the office.\" Just then Charles entered the room and\\nbade good morning to his father.\\n\\n\"Good morning,\" replied his father, rather coldly, and for a moment\\nthere was an awkward silence.\\n\\n\"Charles,\" said Mr. Romaine, \"after having witnessed the scene of last\\nnight, I have come to the conclusion to dissolve the partnership between\\nus.\"\\n\\n\"Just as you please,\" said Charles in a tone of cold indifference that\\nirritated his father; but he maintained his self-control.\\n\\n\"I am sorry that you will persist in your downward course; but if you\\nare determined to throw yourself away I have made up my mind to cut\\nloose from you. I noticed last week when you were getting out the briefs\\nin that Sumpter case, you were not yourself, and several times lately\\nyou have made me hang my head in the court room. I am sorry, very\\nsorry,\" and a touch of deep emotion gave a tone of tenderness to the\\nclosing sentence. There was a slight huskiness in Charles\\' voice, as he\\nreplied, \"Whenever the articles of dissolution are made out I am ready\\nto sign.\"\\n\\n\"They shall be ready by to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"All right, I will sign them.\"\\n\\n\"And what then?\"\\n\\n\"Set up for myself, the world is wide enough for us both.\"\\n\\nAfter Mr. Romaine had left the room, Charles sat, burying his head in\\nhis hands and indulging bitter thoughts toward his father. \"To-day,\" he\\nsaid to himself, \"he resolved to cut loose from me apparently forgetting\\nthat it was from his hands, and at his table I received my first glass\\nof wine. He prides himself on his power of self-control, and after all\\nwhat does it amount to? It simply means this, that he has an iron\\nconstitution, and can drink five times as much as I can without showing\\nits effects, and to-day if Mr. R.N. would ask him to sign the\\ntotal-abstinence pledge, he wouldn\\'t hear to it. Yes I am ready to sign\\nany articles he will bring, even if it is to sign never to enter this\\nhouse, or see his face; but my mother--poor mother, I am sorry for her\\nsake.\"\\n\\nJust then his mother entered the room.\\n\\n\"My son.\"\\n\\n\"Mother.\"\\n\\n\"Just what I feared has come to pass. I have dreaded more than anything\\nelse this collision with your father.\"\\n\\n\"Now mother don\\'t be so serious about this matter. Father\\'s law office\\ndoes not take in the whole world. I shall either set up for myself in\\nA.P., or go West.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! don\\'t talk of going away, I think I should die of anxiety if you\\nwere away.\"\\n\\n\"Well, as I passed down the street yesterday I saw there was an office\\nto let in Frazier\\'s new block, and I think I will engage it and put out\\nmy sign. How will that suit you?\"\\n\\n\"Anything, or anywhere, Charlie, so you are near me. And Charlie don\\'t\\nbe too stout with your father, he was very much out of temper when you\\ncame home last night, but be calm; it will blow over in a few days,\\ndon\\'t add fuel to the fire. And you know that you and Miss Roland are to\\nbe married in two weeks, and I do wish that things might remain as they\\nare, at least till after the wedding. Separation just now might give\\nrise to some very unpleasant talk, and I would rather if you and your\\nfather can put off this dissolution, that you will consent to let things\\nremain as they are for a few weeks longer. When your father comes home I\\nwill put the case to him, and have the thing delayed. Just now Charles I\\ndread the consequences of a separation.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Mother, just as you please; perhaps the publication of the\\narticles of dissolution in the paper might complicate matters.\"\\n\\nWhen Mr. Romaine returned home, his wrath was somewhat mollified, and\\nMrs. Romaine having taken care to prepare his favorite dishes for\\ndinner, took the opportunity when he had dined to entreat him to delay\\nthe intended separation till after the wedding, to which he very\\ngraciously consented.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAgain there was a merry gathering at the home of Jeanette Roland. It was\\nher wedding night, and she was about to clasp hands for life with\\nCharles Romaine. True to her idea of taking things as she found them,\\nshe had consented to be his wife without demanding of him any\\nreformation from the habit which was growing so fearfully upon him. His\\nwealth and position in society like charity covered a multitude of\\nsins. At times Jeanette felt misgivings about the step she was about to\\ntake, but she put back the thoughts like unwelcome intruders, and like\\nthe Ostrich, hiding her head in the sand, instead of avoiding the\\ndanger, she shut her eyes to its fearful reality. That night the wine\\nflowed out like a purple flood; but the men and women who drank were\\npeople of culture, wealth and position, and did not seem to think it was\\njust as disgraceful or more so to drink in excess in magnificently\\nfurnished parlors, as it was in low Barrooms or miserable dens where\\nvice and poverty are huddled together. And if the weary children of\\nhunger and hard toil instead of seeking sleep as nature\\'s sweet\\nrestorer, sought to stimulate their flagging energies in the enticing\\ncup, they with the advantages of wealth, culture and refinement could\\nnot plead the excuses of extreme wretchedness, or hard and unremitting\\ndrudgery.\\n\\n\"How beautiful, very beautiful,\" fell like a pleasant ripple upon the\\near of Jeanette Roland, as she approached the altar, beneath her wreath\\nof orange blossoms, while her bridal veil floated like a cloud of lovely\\nmist from her fair young head. The vows were spoken, the bridal ring\\nplaced upon her finger, and amid a train of congratulating friends, she\\nreturned home where a sumptuous feast awaited them.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t talk so loud, but I think Belle Gordon acted wisely when she\\nrefused Mr. Romaine,\" said Mrs. Gladstone, one of the guests.\\n\\n\"Do you, indeed? Why Charles Romaine, is the only son of Mr. Romaine,\\nand besides being the heir he has lately received a large legacy from\\nhis grandfather\\'s estate. I think Jeanette has made a splendid match. I\\nhope my girls will do as well.\"\\n\\n\"I hope on the other hand that my girls will never marry unless they do\\nbetter.\"\\n\\n\"Why how you talk! What\\'s the matter with Mr. Romaine?\"\\n\\n\"Look at him now,\" said Mrs. Fallard joining in the conversation. \"This\\nis his wedding night and yet you can plainly see he is under the\\ninfluence of wine. Look at those eyes, don\\'t you know how beautiful and\\nclear they are when he is sober, and how very interesting he is in\\nconversation. Now look at him, see how muddled his eye is--but he is\\napproaching--listen to his utterance, don\\'t you notice how thick it is?\\nNow if on his wedding night, he can not abstain, I have very grave fears\\nfor Jeanette\\'s future.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you are both right, but I never looked at things in that light\\nbefore, and I know that a magnificent fortune can melt like snow in the\\nhands of a drunken man.\"\\n\\n\"I wish you much joy,\" rang out a dozen voices, as Jeanette approached\\nthem. \"Oh Jeanette, you just look splendid! and Mr. Romaine, oh he is so\\nhandsome.\" \"Oh Jeanette what\\'s to hinder you from being so happy?\" \"But\\nwhere is Mr. Romaine? we have missed him for some time.\" \"I don\\'t know,\\nlet me seek my husband.\" \"Isn\\'t that a mouthful?\" said Jeanette\\nlaughingly disengaging herself from the merry group, as an undefined\\nsense of apprehension swept over her. Was it a presentiment of coming\\ndanger? An unspoken prophecy to be verified by bitter tears, and lonely\\nfear that seemed for a moment to turn life\\'s sweetness into bitterness\\nand gall. In the midst of a noisy group, in the dining room, she found\\nCharles drinking the wine as it gave its color aright in the cup. She\\nsaw the deep flush upon his cheek, and the cloudiness of his eye, and\\nfor the first time upon that bridal night she felt a shiver of fear as\\nthe veil was suddenly lifted before her unwilling eye; and half\\nreluctantly she said to herself, \"Suppose after all my cousin Belle was\\nright.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XVI\\n\\n\\n\"Good morning! Mr. Clifford,\" said Joe Gough, entering the store of Paul\\nClifford, the next day after he joined the Reform Club. \"I have heard\\nthat you wanted some one to help you, and I am ready to do anything to\\nmake an honest living.\"\\n\\n\"I am very sorry,\" said Paul, \"but I have just engaged a young man\\nbelonging to our Club to come this morning.\"\\n\\nJoe looked sad, but not discouraged, and said, \"Mr. Clifford, I want to\\nturn over a new leaf in my life, but everyone does not know that. Do you\\nknow of any situation I can get? I have been a book-keeper and a\\nsalesman in the town of C., where I once lived, but I am willing to\\nbegin almost anywhere on the ladder of life, and make it a\\nstepping-stone to something better.\"\\n\\nThere was a tone of earnestness in his voice, and an air of\\ndetermination, in his manner that favorably impressed Paul Clifford and\\nhe replied,----\\n\\n\"I was thinking of a friend of mine who wants a helping hand; but it may\\nnot be, after all, the kind of work you prefer. He wants a porter, but\\nas you say you want to make your position a stepping-stone to something\\nbetter, if you make up your mind to do your level best, the way may open\\nbefore you in some more congenial and unexpected quarter. Wait a few\\nminutes, and I will give you a line to him. No! I can do better than\\nthat; he is a member of our Club, and I will see him myself; but before\\nyou do, had we better not go to the barber\\'s?\"\\n\\n\"I would like to,\" said Joe, \"but I haven\\'t--\"\\n\\n\"Haven\\'t the money?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Mr. Clifford, that\\'s the fact, I am not able to pay even for a\\nshave. Oh! what a fool I have been.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! well never mind, let the dead past, bury its dead. The future is\\nbefore you, try and redeem that. If you accept it, I will lend you a few\\ndollars. I believe in lending a helping hand. So come with me to the\\nbarber\\'s and I\\'ll make it all right, you can pay me when you are able,\\nbut here we are at the door, let us go in.\"\\n\\nThey entered, and in a few moments Joe\\'s face was under the manipulating\\ncare of the barber.\\n\\n\"Fix this so,\" said Joe to the barber, giving him directions how to cut\\nhis mustache.\\n\\nPaul was somewhat amused, and yet in that simple act, he saw a return of\\nself-respect, and was glad to see its slightest manifestations, and it\\nwas pleasant to witness the satisfaction with which Joe beheld himself\\nin the glass, as he exclaimed, \"Why Mary would hardly know me!\"\\n\\n\"Suppose now, we go to the tailor\\'s and get some new rigging?\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Clifford,\" said Joe hesitatingly, \"you are very kind, but I don\\'t\\nknow when I shall be able to pay you, and--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! never mind, when you are able I will send my bill. It will help you\\nin looking for a place to go decently dressed. So let us go into the\\nstore and get a new suit.\"\\n\\nThey entered a clothing store and in a few moments Joe was dressed in a\\nnew suit which made him look almost like another person.\\n\\n\"Now, we are ready,\" said Paul, \"appearances are not so much against\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"Good morning Mr. Tennant,\" said Paul to the proprietor of a large\\nstore. \"I heard last night that you wanted help in your store and I have\\nbrought you Mr. Gough, who is willing to take any situation you will\\ngive him, and I will add, he is a member of our Reform Club.\"\\n\\nMr. Tennant looked thoughtfully a moment, and replied, \"I have only one\\nvacancy, and I do not think it would suit your friend. My porter died\\nyesterday and that is the only situation which I can offer him at\\npresent.\"\\n\\n\"I will accept it,\" said Joe, \"if you will give it to me, I am willing\\nto do anything to make an honest living for my family.\"\\n\\n\"Well you can come to-morrow, or stop now and begin.\"\\n\\n\"All right,\" said Joe with a promptness that pleased his employer, and\\nJoe was installed in the first day\\'s regular work he had had for months.\\n\\n\"What! sitting up sewing?\" said Belle Gordon entering the neat room\\nwhere Mrs. Gough was rejuvenating a dress for her older daughter. \"Why\\nyou look like another woman, your cheeks are getting plump, your eyes\\nare brightening, and you look so happy.\"\\n\\n\"I feel just like I look, Miss Gordon. Joe has grown so steady, he gets\\nconstant work, and he is providing so well for us all, and he won\\'t hear\\nto me taking again that slop-shop work. He says all he wants me to do,\\nis to get well, and take care of the home and children. But you look\\nrather pale, have you been sick?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I have been rather unwell for several weeks, and the doctor has\\nordered among other things that I should have a plentiful supply of\\nfresh air, so to-morrow as there is to be a free excursion, and I am on\\nthe Committee, I think if nothing prevents, I shall go. Perhaps you\\nwould like to go?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, if Joe will consent, but--\"\\n\\n\"But, what?\"\\n\\n\"Well Joe has pretty high notions, and I think he may object, because it\\nis receiving charity. I can\\'t blame him for it, but Joe has a right\\nsmart of pride that way.\"\\n\\n\"No! I don\\'t blame him, I rather admire his spirit of self-reliance, and\\nI wouldn\\'t lay the weight of my smallest finger upon his self-respect to\\nrepress it; still I would like to see your Mamy, and Hatty, have a\\nchance to get out into the woods, and have what I call a good time. I\\nthink I can have it so arranged that you can go with me, and serve as\\none of the Committee on refreshments, and your services would be an\\nample compensation for your entertainment.\"\\n\\n\"Well if you put it in that light, I think Joe would be willing for me\\nto go.\"\\n\\n\"I will leave the matter there, and when your husband comes home you can\\nconsult him and send me word. And so you are getting along nicely?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes indeed, splendidly. Just look here, this is Joe\\'s present,\"\\nand Mary held up with both hands a beautifully embossed and illustrated\\nBible. \"This was my birth-day present. Oh! Miss Belle, Joe seems to me\\nlike another man. Last night we went to a conference and prayer-meeting,\\nand Joe spoke. Did you know he had joined the church?\"\\n\\n\"No! when did that happen?\"\\n\\n\"Last week.\"\\n\\n\"Has he become religious?\"\\n\\n\"Well I think Joe\\'s trying to do the best he can. He said last night in\\nmeeting that he felt like a new man, and if they didn\\'t believe he had\\nreligion to ask his wife.\"\\n\\n\"And suppose they had asked you, what would you have said?\"\\n\\n\"I would have said I believe Joe\\'s a changed man, and I hope he will\\nhold out faithful. And Miss Belle I want to be a Christian, but there\\nare some things about religion I can\\'t understand. People often used to\\ntalk to me about getting religion, and getting ready to die. Religion\\nsomehow got associated in my mind with sorrow and death, but it seems to\\nme since I have known you and Mr. Clifford the thing looks different. I\\ngot it associated with something else besides the pall, the hearse, and\\nweeping mourners. You have made me feel that it is as beautiful and\\nvaluable for life as it is necessary for death. And yet there are some\\nthings I can\\'t understand. Miss Belle will you be shocked if I tell you\\nsomething which has often puzzled me?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, I hope you have nothing very shocking to tell me.\"\\n\\n\"Well perhaps it is, and maybe I had better not say it.\"\\n\\n\"But you have raised my curiosity, and woman like I want to hear it.\"\\n\\n\"Now don\\'t be shocked, but let me ask you, if you really believe that\\nGod is good?\"\\n\\n\"Yes I do, and to doubt it would be to unmoor my soul from love, from\\npeace, and rest. It seems to me to believe that must be the first\\nresting place for my soul, and I feel that with me\\n\\n \"To doubt would be disloyalty\\n  To falter would be sin.\\n\\n\"But my dear I have been puzzled just as you have, and can say,----\\n\\n \"I have wandered in mazes dark and distressing\\n  I\\'ve had not a cheering ray my spirit to bless,\\n  Cheerless unbelief held my laboring soul in grief.\"\\n\\n\"And what then?\"\\n\\n \"I then turned to the Gospel that taught me to pray\\n  And trust in the living word from folly away.\\n\\n\"And it was here my spirit found a resting place, and I feel that in\\nbelieving I have entered into rest.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said Mary to herself when Belle was gone, \"there is something so\\nrestful and yet inspiring in her words. I wish I had her faith.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XVII\\n\\n\\n\"I am sorry, very sorry,\" said Belle Gordon, as a shadow of deep\\ndistress flitted over her pale sad face. She was usually cheerful and\\nserene in her manner; but now it seemed as if the very depths of her\\nsoul had been stirred by some mournful and bitter memory. \"Your question\\nwas so unexpected and--\"\\n\\n\"And what!\" said Paul in a tone of sad expectancy, \"so unwelcome?\"\\n\\n\"It was so sudden, I was not prepared for it.\"\\n\\n\"I do not,\" said Paul, \"ask an immediate reply. Give yourself ample time\\nfor consideration.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Clifford,\" said Belle, her voice gathering firmness as she\\nproceeded, \"while all the relations of life demand that there should be\\nentire truthfulness between us and our fellow creatures, I think we\\nshould be especially sincere and candid in our dealings with each other\\non this question of marriage, a question not only as affecting our own\\nwelfare but that of[5] others, a relation which may throw its sunshine\\nor shadow over the track of unborn ages. Permit me now to say to you,\\nthat there is no gentleman of my acquaintance whom I esteem more highly\\nthan yourself; but when you ask me for my heart and hand, I almost feel\\nas if I had no heart to give; and you know it would be wrong to give my\\nhand where I could not place my heart.\"\\n\\n\"But would it be impossible for you to return my affection?\" \"I don\\'t\\nknow, but I am only living out my [vow] of truthfulness when I say to\\nyou, I feel as if I had been undone for love. You tell that in offering\\nyour hand that you bring me a heart unhackneyed in the arts of love,\\nthat my heart is the first and only shrine on which you have ever laid\\nthe wealth of your affections. I cannot say the same in reply. I have\\nhad my bright and beautiful day dream, but it has faded, and I have\\nlearned what is the hardest of all lessons for a woman to learn. I have\\nlearned to live without love.\"\\n\\n\"Oh no,\" said Paul, \"not to live without love. In darkened homes how\\nmany grateful hearts rejoice to hear your footsteps on the threshold. I\\nhave seen the eyes of young Arabs of the street grow brighter as you\\napproached and say, \\'That\\'s my lady, she comes to see my mam when she\\'s\\nsick.\\' And I have seen little girls in the street quicken their face to\\ncatch a loving smile from their dear Sunday school teacher. Oh Miss\\nBelle instead of living without love, I think you are surrounded with a\\ncordon of loving hearts.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and I appreciate them--but this is not the love to which I refer.\\nI mean a love which is mine, as anything else on earth is mine, a love\\nprecious, enduring and strong, which brings hope and joy and sunshine\\nover one\\'s path in life. A love which commands my allegiance and demands\\nmy respect. This is the love I have learned to do without, and perhaps\\nthe poor and needy had learned to love me less, had this love surrounded\\nme more.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Belle, perhaps I was presumptuous, to have asked a return of the\\nearnest affection I have for you; but I had hoped that you would give\\nthe question some consideration; and may I not hope that you will think\\nkindly of my proposal? Oh Miss Gordon, ever since the death of my\\nsainted mother, I have had in my mind\\'s eye the ideal of a woman nobly\\nplanned, beautiful, intellectual, true and affectionate, and you have\\nfilled out that ideal in all its loveliest proportions, and I hope that\\nmy desire will not be like reaching out to some bright particular star\\nand wishing to win it. It seems to me,\" he said with increasing\\nearnestness, \"whatever obstacle may be in the way, I would go through\\nfire and water to remove it.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry,\" said Belle as if speaking to herself, and her face had an\\nabsent look about it, as if instead of being interested in the living\\npresent she was grouping amid the ashes of the dead past. At length she\\nsaid, \"Mr. Clifford, permit me to say in the first place, let there be\\ntruth between us. If my heart seems callous and indifferent to your\\nlove, believe me it is warm to esteem and value you as a friend, I might\\nalmost say as a brother, for in sympathy of feeling and congeniality of\\ndisposition you are nearer to me than my own brother; but I do not think\\nwere I so inclined that it would be advisable for me to accept your hand\\nwithout letting you know something of my past history. I told you a few\\nmoments since that I had my day dream. Permit me to tell you, for I\\nthink you are entitled to my confidence. The object of that day dream\\nwas Charles Romaine.\"\\n\\n\"Charles Romaine!\" and there was a tone of wonder in the voice, and a\\npuzzled look on the face of Paul Clifford.\\n\\n\"Yes! Charles Romaine, not as you know him now, with the marks of\\ndissipation on his once handsome face, but Charles Romaine, as I knew\\nhim when he stood upon the threshold of early manhood, the very\\nincarnation of beauty, strength and grace. Not Charles Romaine with the\\nblurred and bloated countenance, the staggering gait, the confused and\\nvacant eye; but Charles Romaine as a young, handsome and talented\\nlawyer, the pride of our village, the hope of his father and the joy of\\nhis mother; before whom the future was opening full of rich and rare\\npromises. Need I tell you that when he sought my hand in preference to\\nall the other girls in our village, that I gave him what I never can\\ngive to another, the first, deep love of my girlish heart. For nearly a\\nwhole year I wore his betrothal ring upon my finger, when I saw to my\\nutter anguish and dismay that he was fast becoming a drunkard. Oh! Mr.\\nClifford if I could have saved him I would have taken blood from every\\nvein and strength from every nerve. We met frequently at entertainments.\\nI noticed time after time, the effects of the wine he had imbibed, upon\\nhis manner and conversation. At first I shrank from remonstrating with\\nhim, until the burden lay so heavy on my heart that I felt I must speak\\nout, let the consequences be what they might. And so one evening I told\\nhim plainly and seriously my fears about his future. He laughed lightly\\nand said my fears were unfounded; that I was nervous and giving away to\\nidle fancies; that his father always had wine at the table, and that he\\nhad never seen him under the influence of liquor. Silenced, but not\\nconvinced, I watched his course with painful solicitude. All\\nremonstrances on my part seemed thrown away; he always had the precedent\\nof his father to plead in reply to my earnest entreaties. At last when\\nremonstrances and entreaties seemed to be all in vain, I resolved to\\nbreak the engagement. It may have been a harsh and hard alternative, but\\nI would not give my hand where my respect could not follow. It may be\\nthat I thought too much of my own happiness, but I felt that marriage\\nmust be for me positive misery or positive happiness, and I feared that\\nif I married a man so lacking in self-control as to become a common\\ndrunkard, that when I ceased to love and respect him, I should be\\nconstantly tempted to hate and despise him. I think one of the saddest\\nfates that can befall a woman is to be tied for life to a miserable\\nbloated wreck of humanity. There may be some women with broad generous\\nhearts, and great charity, strong enough to lift such men out of the\\ndepths, but I had no such faith in my strength and so I gave him back\\nhis ring. He accepted it, but we parted as friends. For awhile after our\\nengagement was broken, we occasionally met at the houses of our mutual\\nfriends in social gatherings and I noticed with intense satisfaction\\nthat whenever wine was offered he scrupulously abstained from ever\\ntasting a drop, though I think at times his self-control was severely\\ntested. Oh! what hope revived in my heart. Here I said to myself is\\ncompensation for all I have suffered, if by it he shall be restored to\\nmanhood usefulness and society, and learn to make his life not a thing\\nof careless ease and sensuous indulgence, but of noble struggle and high\\nand holy endeavor. But while I was picturing out for him a magnificent\\nfuture, imagining the lofty triumphs of his intellect--an intellect\\ngrand in its achievements and glorious in its possibilities, my\\nbeautiful daydream was rudely broken up, and vanished away like the rays\\nof sunset mingling with the shadows of night. My Aunt Mrs. Roland,\\ncelebrated her silver-wedding and my cousin\\'s birth-day by giving a\\nlarge entertainment; and among other things she had a plentiful supply\\nof wine. Mr. Romaine had lately made the acquaintance of my cousin\\nJeanette Roland. She was both beautiful in person and fascinating in her\\nmanners, and thoughtlessly she held a glass of wine in her hand and\\nasked Mr. Romaine if he would not honor the occasion, by drinking her\\nmother\\'s health. For a moment he hesitated, his cheek paled and flushed\\nalternately, he looked irresolute. While I watched him in silent anguish\\nit seemed as if the agony of years was compressed in a few moments. I\\ntried to catch his eye but failed, and with a slight tremor in his hand\\nhe lifted the glass to his lips and drank. I do not think I would have\\nfelt greater anguish had I seen him suddenly drowned in sight of land.\\nOh! Mr. Clifford that night comes before me so vividly, it seems as if I\\nam living it all over again. I do not think Mr. Romaine has ever\\nrecovered from the reawakening of his appetite. He has since married\\nJeanette. I meet her occasionally. She has a beautiful home, dresses\\nmagnificently, and has a retinue of servants; and yet I fancy she is not\\nhappy. That somewhere hidden out of sight there is a worm eating at the\\ncore of her life. She has a way of dropping her eyes and an absent look\\nabout her that I do not fully understand, but it seems to me that I miss\\nthe old elasticity of her spirits, the merry ring of her voice, the\\npleasant thrills of girlish laughter, and though she never confesses it\\nto me I doubt that Jeanette is happy. And with this sad experience in\\nthe past can you blame me if I am slow, very slow to let the broken\\ntendrils of my heart entwine again?\"\\n\\n\"Miss Belle,\" said Paul Clifford catching eagerly at the smallest straw\\nof hope, \"if you can not give me the first love of a fresh young life, I\\nam content with the rich [aftermath?] of your maturer years, and ask\\nfrom life no higher prize; may I not hope for that?\"\\n\\n\"I will think on it but for the present let us change the subject.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\"Do you think Jeanette is happy? She seems so different from what she\\nused to be,\" said Miss Tabitha Jones to several friends who were\\nspending the evening with her.\\n\\n\"Happy!\" replied Mary Gladstone, \"don\\'t see what\\'s to hinder her from\\nbeing happy. She has everything that heart can wish. I was down to her\\nhouse yesterday, and she has just moved in her new home. It has all the\\nmodern improvements, and everything is in excellent taste. Her furniture\\nis of the latest style, and I think it is really superb.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said her sister, \"and she dresses magnificently. Last week she\\nshowed me a most beautiful set of jewelry, and a camel\\'s hair shawl, and\\nI believe it is real camel\\'s hair. I think you could almost run it\\nthrough a ring. If I had all she has, I think I should be as happy as\\nthe days are long. I don\\'t believe I would let a wave of trouble roll\\nacross my peaceful breast.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Annette,\" said Mrs. Gladstone, \"don\\'t speak so extravagantly, and I\\ndon\\'t like to hear you quote those lines for such an occasion.\"\\n\\n\"Why not mother? Where\\'s the harm?\"\\n\\n\"That hymn has been associated in my mind with my earliest religious\\nimpressions and experience, and I don\\'t like to see you lift it out of\\nits sacred associations, for such a trifling occasion.\"\\n\\n\"Oh mother you are so strict. I shall never be able to keep time with\\nyou, but I do think, if I was off as Jeanette, that I would be as blithe\\nand happy as a lark, and instead of that she seems to be constantly\\ndrooping and fading.\"\\n\\n\"Annette,\" said Mrs. Gladstone, \"I knew a woman who possesses more than\\nJeanette does, and yet she died of starvation.\"\\n\\n\"Died of starvation! Why, when, and where did that happen? and what\\nbecame of her husband?\"\\n\\n\"He is in society, caressed and [ ed?] on by the young girls of his set\\nand I have seen a number of managing mammas to whom I have imagined he\\nwould not be an objectionable son-in-law.\"\\n\\n\"Do I know him mother?\"\\n\\n\"No! and I hope you never will.\"\\n\\n\"Well mother I would like to know how he starved his wife to death and\\nyet escaped the law.\"\\n\\n\"The law helped him.\"\\n\\n\"Oh mother!\" said both girls opening their eyes in genuine astonishment.\\n\\n\"I thought,\" said Mary Gladstone, \"it was the province of the law to\\nprotect women, I was just telling Miss Basanquet yesterday, when she\\nwas talking about woman\\'s suffrage that I had as many rights as I wanted\\nand that I was willing to let my father and brothers do all the voting\\nfor me.\"\\n\\n\"Forgetting my dear, that there are millions of women who haven\\'t such\\nfathers and brothers as you have. No my dear, when you examine the\\nmatter, a little more closely, you will find there are some painful\\ninequalities in the law for women.\"\\n\\n\"But mother, I do think it would be a dreadful thing for women to vote\\nOh! just think of women being hustled and crowded at the polls by rude\\nmen, their breaths reeking with whiskey and tobacco, the very air heavy\\nwith their oaths. And then they have the polls at public houses. Oh\\nmother, I never want to see the day when women vote.\"\\n\\n\"Well I do, because we have one of the kindest and best fathers and\\nhusbands and good brothers, who would not permit the winds of heaven to\\nvisit us too roughly, there is no reason we should throw ourselves\\nbetween the sunshine and our less fortunate sisters who shiver in the\\nblast.\"\\n\\n\"But mother, I don\\'t see how voting would help us, I am sure we have\\ninfluence I have often heard papa say that you were the first to awaken\\nhim to a sense of the enormity of slavery. Now mother if we women would\\nuse our influence with our fathers, brothers, husbands, and sons, could\\nwe not have everything we want.\"\\n\\n\"No, my dear we could not, with all our influence we never could have\\nthe same sense of responsibility which flows from the possession of\\npower. I want women to possess power as well as influence, I want every\\nChristian woman as she passes by a grogshop or liquor saloon, to feel\\nthat she has on her heart a burden of responsibility for its existence,\\nI hold my dear that a nation as well as an individual should have a\\nconscience, and on this liquor question there is room for woman\\'s\\nconscience not merely as a persuasive influence but as an enlightened\\nand aggressive power.\"\\n\\n\"Well Ma I think you would make a first class stump speaker. I expect\\nwhen women vote we shall be constantly having calls, for the gifted, and\\ntalented Mrs. Gladstone to speak on the duties and perils of the hour.\"\\n\\n\"And I would do it, I would go among my sister women and try to persuade\\nthem to use their vote as a moral lever, not to make home less happy,\\nbut society more holy. I would have good and sensible women, grave in\\nmanner, and cultured in intellect, attend the primary meetings and bring\\ntheir moral influence and political power to frown down corruption,\\nchicanery, and low cunning.\"\\n\\n\"But mother just think if women went to the polls how many vicious ones\\nwould go?\"\\n\\n\"I hope and believe for the honor of our sex that the vicious women of\\nthe community are never in the majority, that for one woman whose feet\\nturn aside from the paths of rectitude that there are thousands of feet\\nthat never stray into forbidden paths, and today I believe there is\\nvirtue enough in society to confront its vice, and intelligence enough\\nto grapple with its ignorance.\"[6]\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XVIII\\n\\n\\n\"Why Mrs. Gladstone,\" said Miss Tabitha, \"you are as zealous as a new\\nconvert to the cause of woman suffrage. We single women who are\\nconstantly taxed without being represented, know what it is to see\\nignorance and corruption striking hands together and voting away our\\nmoney for whatever purposes they choose. I pay as large a tax as many of\\nthe men in A.P., and yet cannot say who shall assess my property for a\\nsingle year.\"\\n\\n\"And there is another thing,\" said Mrs. Gladstone, \"ought to be brought\\nto the consideration of the men, and it is this. They refuse to let us\\nvote and yet fail to protect our homes from the ravages of rum. My\\nyoung friend, whom I said died of starvation; foolishly married a\\ndissipated man who happened to be rich and handsome. She was gentle,\\nloving, sensitive to a fault. He was querulous, fault-finding and\\nirritable, because his nervous system was constantly unstrung by liquor.\\nShe lacked tenderness, sympathy and heart support, and at last faded and\\ndied, not starvation of the body, but a trophy of the soul, and when I\\nsay the law helped, I mean it licensed the places that kept the\\ntemptation ever in his way. And I fear, that is the secret of Jeanette\\'s\\nfaded looks, and unhappy bearing.\"\\n\\nNo Jeanette was not happy. Night after night would she pace the floor of\\nher splendidly furnished chamber waiting and watching for her husband\\'s\\nfootsteps. She and his friends had hoped that her influence would be\\nstrong enough to win him away from his boon companions, that his home\\nand beautiful bride would present superior attractions to Anderson\\'s\\nsaloon, his gambling pool, and champaign suppers, and for a while they\\ndid, but soon the novelty wore off, and Jeanette found out to her great\\ngrief that her power to bind him to the simple attractions of home were\\nas futile as a role of cobwebs to moor a ship to the shore, when it has\\ndrifted out and is dashing among the breakers. He had learned to live an\\nelement of excitement, and to depend upon artificial stimulation, until\\nit seemed as if the very blood in his veins grew sluggish fictitious\\nexcitement was removed. His father, hopeless of his future, had\\ndissolved partnership with him, and for months there had been no\\ncommunication between them; and Jeanette saw with agony and dismay that\\nhis life was being wrecked upon the broad sea of sin and shame.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\"Where is his father? The child can\\'t live. It is one of the worst cases\\nof croup I have had this year, why didn\\'t you send for me sooner? Where\\nis his father? It is now just twelve o\\'clock, time for all respectable\\nmen to be in the house,\" said the bluff but kind hearted family doctor\\nlooking tenderly upon Jeanette\\'s little boy who lay gasping for breath\\nin the last stages of croup.\\n\\n\"Oh! I don\\'t know,\" said Jeanette her face crimsoning beneath the\\ndoctor\\'s searching glance. \"I suppose he is down to Anderson\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Anderson\\'s!\" said the doctor in a tone of hearty indignation, \"what\\nbusiness has he there, and his child dying here?\"\\n\\n\"But doctor, he didn\\'t know, the child had fever when he went out, but\\nneither of us thought much of it till I was awakened by his strange and\\nunnatural breathing. I sent for you as soon as I could rouse the\\nservants.\" \"Well rouse them again, and tell them to go down to\\nAnderson\\'s and tell your husband that his child is dying.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no not dying doctor, you surely don\\'t mean it.\" \"Yes Jeanette,\"\\nsaid the old family doctor, tenderly and sadly, \"I can do nothing for\\nhim, let me take him in my arms and rest you. Dear little darling, he\\nwill be saved from the evils to come.\"\\n\\nJust as his life was trembling on its frailest chords, and its delicate\\nmachinery almost wound up, Charles Romaine returned, sober enough to\\ntake in the situation. He strode up to the dying child, took the clammy\\nhands in his, and said in a tone of bitter anguish, \"Charlie, don\\'t you\\nknow papa? Wouldn\\'t you speak one little word to papa?\" But it was too\\nlate, the shadows that never deceive flitted over the pale beauty of the\\nmarble brow, the waxen lid closed over the once bright and laughing eye,\\nand the cold grave for its rest had won the child.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XIX\\n\\n\\n[Text missing.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XX\\n\\n\\nIf riches could bring happiness, John Anderson should be a happy man;\\nand yet he is far from being happy. He has succeeded in making money,\\nbut failed in every thing else. But let us enter his home. As you open\\nthe parlor door your feet sink in the rich and beautiful carpet.\\nExquisite statuary, and superbly framed pictures greet your eye and you\\nare ready to exclaim, \"Oh! how lovely.\" Here are the beautiful\\nconceptions of painters\\' art and sculptors\\' skill. It is a home of\\nwealth, luxury and display, but not of love, refinement and culture.\\nYears since, before John Anderson came to live in the city of A.P. he\\nhad formed an attachment for an excellent young lady who taught school\\nin his native village, and they were engaged to be married; but after\\ncoming to the city and forming new associations, visions of wealth\\ndazzled his brain, and unsettled his mind, till the idea of love in a\\ncottage grew distasteful to him. He had seen men with no more ability\\nthan himself who had come to the city almost pennyless, and who had\\ngrown rich in a few years, and he made up his mind that if possible he\\nwould do two things, acquire wealth and live an easy life, and he\\nthought the easiest way to accomplish both ends was to open up a\\ngorgeous palace of sin and entice into his meshes the unwary, the\\ninexperienced, and the misguided slaves of appetite. For awhile after he\\nleft his native village, he wrote almost constantly to his betrothed;\\nbut as new objects and interests engaged his attention, his letters\\nbecame colder and less frequent, until they finally ceased and the\\nengagement was broken. At first the blow fell heavily upon the heart of\\nhis affianced, but she was too sensible to fade away and die the victim\\nof unrequited love, and in after years when she had thrown her whole\\nsoul into the temperance cause, and consecrated her life to the work of\\nuplifting fallen humanity, she learned to be thankful that it was not\\nher lot to be united to a man who stood as a barrier across the path of\\nhuman progress and would have been a weight to her instead of wings.\\nReleased from his engagement, he entered into an alliance (for that is\\nthe better name for a marriage) which was not a union of hearts, or\\nintercommunion of kindred souls; but only an affair of convenience; in a\\nword he married for money a woman, who was no longer young in years, nor\\nbeautiful in person, nor amiable in temper. But she was rich, and her\\nmoney like charity covered a multitude of faults, and as soon as he saw\\nthe golden bait he caught at it, and they were married, for he was\\nwilling to do almost any thing for money, except work hard for it. It\\nwas a marriage however that brought no happiness to either party. Mrs.\\nAnderson was an illy educated, self willed, narrow minded [woman], full\\nof airs and pretensions, the only daughter of a man who had laid the\\nfoundation of his wealth by keeping a low groggery, and dying had left\\nher his only heir. John Anderson was selfish and grasping. He loved\\nmoney, and she loved display, and their home was often the scene of the\\nmost pitiful contentions about money matters. Harsh words and bitter\\nrecriminations were almost common household usages. The children brought\\nup in this unhealthy atmosphere naturally took sides with their mother\\nand their home was literally a house divided against itself. The foolish\\nconduct of the mother inspired the children with disrespect for their\\nfather, who failed to support the authority of his wife as the mother\\nand mistress of the home. As her sons grew older they often sought\\nattractions in questionable places, away from the sombre influences of\\ntheir fireside, and the daughters as soon as they stood upon the verge\\nof early womanhood learned to look upon marriage as an escape valve from\\ndomestic discomforts; and in that beautiful home with all its costly\\nsurroundings, and sumptuous furniture, there was always something\\nwanting, there was always a lack of tenderness, sympathy and mutual\\nesteem.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t afford it,\" said John Anderson, to his wife who had been asking\\nfor money for a trip to a fashionable watering place. \"You will have to\\nspend the summer elsewhere.\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t afford it! What nonsense; is not it as much to your interest as\\nmine to carry the girls around and give them a chance?\"\\n\\n\"A chance for what?\"\\n\\n\"Why to see something of the world. You don\\'t know what may happen. That\\nEnglish Earl was very attentive last night to Sophronia at Mrs. Jessap\\'s\\nball.\"\\n\\n\"An English Count? who is he? and where did he spring from?\"\\n\\n\"Why he\\'s from England, and is said to be the only son and heir of a\\nvery rich nobleman.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe it, I don\\'t believe he is an Earl any more than I am.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s just like you, always throw cold water on every thing I say\"\\n\\n\"It is no such thing, but I don\\'t believe in picking up strangers and\\nputting them into my bosom; it is not all gold that glitters.\"\\n\\n\"I know that, but how soon can you let me have some money? I want to go\\nout this afternoon and do some shopping and engage the semptress.\"\\n\\n\"I tell you, Annette, I have not the money to spare; the money market is\\nvery tight, and I have very heavy bills to meet this month.\"\\n\\n\"The money market tight! why it has been tight ever since I have been\\nmarried.\"\\n\\n\"Well you may believe it or not, just as you choose, but I tell you this\\ncrusading has made quite a hole in my business.\"\\n\\n\"Now John Anderson, tell that to somebody that don\\'t know. I don\\'t\\nbelieve this crusading has laid a finger\\'s weight upon your business.\"\\n\\n\"Yes it has, and if you read the papers you would find that it has even\\naffected the revenue of the state and you will have to retrench\\nsomewhere.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll retrench somewhere. I think we are paying our servants too\\nhigh wages any how. Mrs. Shenflint gets twice as much work done for the\\nsame money. I\\'ll retrench, John Anderson, but I want you to remember\\nthat I did not marry you empty handed.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think I shall be apt to forget it in a hurry while I have such\\na gentle reminder at hand,\" he replied sarcastically.\\n\\n\"And I suppose you would not have married me if I had had no money.\"\\n\\n\"No, I would not,\" said John Anderson thoroughly exasperated, \"and I\\nwould have been a fool if I had.\"\\n\\nThese bitter words spoken in a heat of passion were calculated to work\\ndisastrously in that sin darkened home.\\n\\nFor some time she had been suspecting that her money had been the chief\\ninducement which led him to seek her hand, and now her worse suspicions\\nwere confirmed, and the last thread of confidence was severed.\\n\\n\"I should not have said it,\" said Anderson to himself, \"but the woman is\\nso provoking and unreasonable. I suppose she will have a fit of sulks\\nfor a month and never be done brooding over those foolish words\"; and\\nAnderson sighed as if he were an ill used man. He had married for money,\\nand he had got what he bargained for; love, confidence, and mutual\\nesteem were not sought in the contract and these do not necessarily come\\nof themselves.\\n\\n\"Well, the best I can do is to give her what money she wants and be done\\nwith it.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\"Is not in her room?\"\\n\\n\"No sir and her bed has not been rumpled.\"\\n\\n\"Where in the world can she be?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, but here is a note she left.\"\\n\\n\"What does she say? read it Annette.\"\\n\\n\"She says she feels that you were unjust to the Earl and that she hopes\\nyou will forgive her the steps she has taken, but by the time the letter\\nreaches you she expects to be the Countess of Clarendon.\"\\n\\n\"Poor foolish girl, you see what comes of taking a stranger to your\\nbosom and making so much of him.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s just like you, John Anderson, every thing that goes wrong is\\nblamed on me. I almost wish I was dead.\"\\n\\n\"I wish so too,\" thought Anderson but he concluded it was prudent to\\nkeep the wish to himself.\\n\\nJohn Anderson had no faith whatever in the pretensions of his new\\nson-in-law, but his vain and foolish wife on the other hand was elated\\nat the dazzling prospects of her daughter, and often in her imagination\\nvisited the palatial residence of \"My Son, the Earl,\" and was graciously\\nreceived in society as the mother of the Countess of Clarendon. She was\\nalso highly gratified at the supposed effect of Sophronia\\'s marriage\\nupon a certain clique who had been too exclusive to admit her in their\\nset. Should not those Gladstone girls be ready to snag themselves? and\\nthere was that Mary Talbot, did every thing she could to attract his\\nattention but it was no go. My little Sophronia came along and took the\\nrag off the bush. I guess they will almost die with envy. If he had\\nwaited for her father\\'s consent we might have waited till the end of the\\nchapter; but I took the responsibility on my shoulders and the thing is\\ndone. My daughter, the Countess of Clarendon. I like the ring of the\\nwords; but dear me here\\'s the morning mail, and a letter from the\\nCountess, but what does it mean?\"\\n\\n\"Come to me, I am in great trouble.\"\\n\\nIn quick response to the appeal Mrs. Anderson took the first train to\\nNew York and found her daughter in great distress. The \"Earl\" had been\\narrested for forgery and stealing, and darker suspicions were hinted\\nagainst him. He had been a body servant to a nobleman who had been\\ntravelling for his health and who had died by a lonely farmhouse where\\nhe had gone for fresh air and quiet, and his servant had seized upon his\\neffects and letters of introduction, and passed himself off as the\\noriginal Earl, and imitating his handwriting had obtained large\\nremittances, for which he was arrested, tried and sent to prison, and\\nthus ended the enchanting dream of \"My daughter the Countess of\\nClarendon.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXI\\n\\n\\n\"I cannot ensure your life a single hour, unless you quit business. You\\nare liable to be stricken with paralysis at any moment, if [once?]\\nsubject to the [least] excitement.[7] Can\\'t you trust your business in\\nthe hands of your sons?\"\\n\\n\"Doctor,\" said John Anderson, \"I have only two boys. My oldest went West\\nseveral years ago, and never writes to us unless he wants something, and\\nas to Frank, if I would put the concern into his hands, he would drink\\nhimself into the grave in less than a month. The whole fact is this, my\\nchildren are the curse of my life,\" and there was bitterness in the tone\\nof John Anderson[8] as he uttered these words of fearful sorrow.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said the doctor, \"you must have rest and quiet or I will not\\nanswer for the consequences.\"\\n\\n\"Rest and quiet!\" said John Anderson to himself, \"I don\\'t see how I am\\nto get it, with such a wife as I have always worrying and bothering me\\nabout something.\" \"Mr. Anderson,\" said one of the servants, \"Mrs.\\nAnderson says please come, as quick as possible into Mr. Frank\\'s room.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter now!\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, but Mr. Frank\\'s acting mightily queer; he thinks there\\nare snakes and lizards crawling over him.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s got the horrors, just what I expected. Tell me about rest and\\nquiet! I\\'ll be there in a minute. Oh what\\'s the matter? I feel strange,\"\\nsaid Anderson falling back on the bed suddenly stricken with paralysis.\\nWhile in another room lay his younger son a victim to delirium tremens,\\nand dying in fearful agony. The curse that John Anderson had sent to\\nother homes had come back darkened with the shadow of death to brood\\nover his own habitation. His son is dying, but he has no word of hope to\\ncheer the parting spirit as it passed out into the eternity, for him the\\ndarkness of the tomb, is not gilded with the glory of the resurrection.\\n\\nThe best medical skill has been summoned to the aid of John Anderson,\\nbut neither art, nor skill can bind anew the broken threads of life. The\\nchamber in which he is confined is a marvel of decoration, light streams\\ninto his home through panes of beautifully stained glass. Pillows of the\\nsoftest down are placed beneath his head, beautiful cushions lie at his\\nfeet that will never take another step on the errands of sin, but no\\nappliances of wealth can give peace to his guilty conscience. He looks\\nback upon the past and the retrospect is a worse than wasted life; and\\nwhen the future looms up before him he shrinks back from the\\ncontemplation, for the sins of the past throw their shadow over the\\nfuture. He has houses, money and land, but he is a pauper in his soul,\\nand a bankrupt in his character. In his eager selfish grasp for gold, he\\nhas shriveled his intellect and hardened and dried up his heart, and in\\nso doing he has cut himself off from the richest sources of human\\nenjoyment. He has wasted life\\'s best opportunities, and there never was\\nan angel, however bright, terrible and strong, that ever had power to\\nroll away the stone from the grave of a dead opportunity, and what John\\nAnderson has lost in time, he can never make up in eternity. He has\\nformed no taste for reading, and thus has cut himself off from the\\nglorious companionship of the good, the great, and the wise of all ages.\\nHe has been selfish, mean and grasping, and the blessing of the poor and\\nneedy never fall as benedictions on his weary head; and in that\\nbeautiful home with disease and death clutching at his heartstrings, he\\nhas wealth that he cannot enjoy, luxuries that pall upon his taste, and\\nmagnificence that can never satisfy the restless craving of his soul.\\nHis life has been a wretched failure. He neglected his children to amass\\nthe ways of iniquity, and their coldness and indifference pierce him\\nlike poisoned arrows. Marriage has brought him money, but not the\\nsweet, tender ministrations of loving wifely care, and so he lives on\\nstarving in the midst of plenty; dying of thirst, with life\\'s sweetest\\nfountains eluding his grasp.\\n\\nCharles Romaine is sleeping in a drunkard\\'s grave. After the death of\\nhis boy there was a decided change in him. Night after night he tore\\nhimself away from John Anderson\\'s saloon, and struggled with the monster\\nthat had enslaved him, and for awhile victory seemed to be perching on\\nthe banner of his resolution. Another child took the place of the first\\nborn, and the dead, and hope and joy began to blossom around Jeanette\\'s\\npath. His mother who had never ceased to visit the house marked the\\nchange with great satisfaction and prevailed upon his father to invite\\nCharles and Jeanette to a New Year\\'s dinner (only a family gathering).\\nJeanette being unwell excused herself from going, and Charles went\\nalone. Jeanette felt a fearful foreboding when she saw him leaving the\\ndoor, and said to herself, \"I hope his father will not offer him wine. I\\nam so afraid that something will happen to him, and yet I hated to\\npersuade him not to go. His mother might think I was averse to his\\nreconciliation with his father.\"\\n\\n\"It looks very natural to have Charles with us again,\" said Mrs.\\nRo[maine] looking fondly on her son.\\n\\n\"Yes, it seems like old times, when I always had my seat next to yours.\"\\n\\n\"And I hope,\" said his father, \"it will never be vacant so long again.\"\\n\\nThe dinner hour passed on enlivened by social chat and pleasant\\nreminiscences, and there was nothing to mar the harmony of the occasion.\\nMrs. Romaine had been careful to keep everything from the table that\\nwould be apt to awaken the old appetite for liquor, but after dinner Mr.\\nRomaine invited Charles into the library to smoke. \"Here,\" said he,\\nhanding him a cigar, \"is one of the finest brands I have smoked lately,\\nand by the way here is some rare old wine, more than 25 years old,\\nwhich was sent to me yesterday by an old friend and college class mate\\nof mine.[9] Let me pour you out a glass.\" Charles suddenly became\\nagitated, but as his father\\'s back was turned to him, pouring out the\\nwine, he did not notice the sudden paling of his cheek, and the\\nhesitation of his manner. And Charles checking back his scruples took\\nthe glass and drained it, to the bottom.\\n\\nThere is a fable, that a certain king once permitted the devil to kiss\\nhis shoulder, and out of those shoulders sprang[10] two serpents that in\\nthe fury of their hunger aimed at his head and tried to get at his\\nbrain. He tried to extricate himself from their terrible power. He tore\\nat them with his fingers and found that it was his own flesh that he was\\nlacerating. Dormant but not dead was the appetite for strong drink in\\nCharles Romaine, and that one glass awakened the serpent coiled up in\\nhis flesh. He went out from his father\\'s house with a newly awakened\\nappetite clamoring and raging for strong drink. Every saloon he passed\\nadding intensity to his craving. At last his appetite overmastered him\\nand he almost rushed into a saloon, and waited impatiently till he was\\nserved. Every nerve seemed to be quivering with excitement,\\nrestlessness; and there was a look of wild despairing anguish on his\\nface, as he clutched the glass to allay the terrible craving of his\\nsystem. He drank till his head was giddy, and his gait was staggering,\\nand then started for home. He entered the gate and slipped on the ice,\\nand being too intoxicated to rise or comprehend his situation, he lay\\nhelpless in the dark and cold, until there crept over him that sleep\\nfrom which there is no awakening, and when morning had broken in all its\\nglory, Charles Romaine had drifted out of life, slain by the wine which\\nat [last] had \"bitten like an adder and stung like a serpent.\" Jeanette\\nhad waited and watched through the small hours of the night, till nature\\no\\'erwearied had sought repose in sleep and rising very early in the\\nmorning, she had gone to the front door to look down the street for his\\ncoming when the first object that met her gaze was the lifeless form of\\nher husband. One wild and bitter shriek rent the air, and she fell\\nfainting on the frozen corpse. Her friends gathered round her, all that\\nlove and tenderness could do was done for the wretched wife, but nothing\\ncould erase from her mind one agonizing sorrow, it was the memory of her\\nfatal triumph over his good resolution years ago at her mother\\'s silver\\nwedding. Carelessly she had sowed the seeds of transgression whose\\nfearful yield was a harvest of bitter misery. Mrs. Clifford came to her\\nin her hour of trial, and tried to comfort and sustain the\\nheart-stricken woman; who had tried to take life easy, but found it\\nterribly hard, and she has measurably succeeded. In the home of her\\ncousin she is trying to bear the burden of her life as well as she can.\\nHer eye never lights up with joy. The bloom and flush have left her\\ncareworn face. Tears from her eyes long used to weeping have blenched\\nthe coloring of her life existence, and she is passing through life with\\nthe shadow of the grave upon her desolate heart.\\n\\nJoe Gough has been true to his pledge, plenty and comfort have taken the\\nplace of poverty and pain. He continued his membership with the church\\nof his choice and Mary is also striving to live a new life, and to be\\nthe ministering angel that keeps his steps, and he feels that in answer\\nto prayer, his appetite for strong drink has been taken away.\\n\\nLife with Mrs. Clifford has become a thing of brightness and beauty, and\\nwhen children sprang up in her path making gladness and sunshine around\\nher home, she was a wife and tender mother, fond but not foolish; firm\\nin her household government, but not stern and unsympathising in her\\nmanner. The faithful friend and companion of her daughters, she won\\ntheir confidence by her loving care and tender caution. She taught them\\nto come to her in their hours of perplexity and trial and to keep no\\nsecrets from her sympathising heart. She taught her sons to be as\\nupright in their lives and as pure in their conversation as she would\\nhave her daughters, recognizing for each only one code of morals and one\\nlaw of spiritual life, and in course of time she saw her daughters\\nripening into such a beautiful womanhood, and her sons entering the\\narena of life not with the simplicity which is ignorant of danger and\\nevil, but with the sterling integrity which baffles the darts of\\ntemptation with the panoply of principle and the armor of uprightness.\\nUnconsciously she elevated the tone of society in which she moved by a\\nlife which was a beautiful and earnest expression of patient continuance\\nin well doing. Paul Clifford\\'s life has been a grand success, not in the\\nmere accumulation of wealth, but in the enrichment of his moral and\\nspiritual nature. He is still ever ready to lend a helping hand. He has\\nnot lived merely for wealth and enjoyment, but happiness, lasting and\\ntrue springs up in his soul as naturally as a flower leaps into\\nblossoms, and whether he is loved or hated, honored or forgotten, he\\nconstantly endeavors to make the world better by his example and\\ngladdened by his presence feeling that if every one would be faithful to\\nduty that even here, Eden would spring up in our path, and Paradise be\\naround our way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n\\n1.

It exists\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\npeople in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\n\\n\\nSection 3.

Newby\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\\'s\\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\\n\\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\\ndownload by the etext year.\\n\\nhttp://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06\\n\\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\\n\\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\\n\\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234\\n\\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689\\n\\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL\\n\\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\\n'"
